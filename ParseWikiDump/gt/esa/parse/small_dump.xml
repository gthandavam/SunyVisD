:This article is about anarchism, an anti-authoritarian philosophy that rejects capitalism.  While this is the most widespread form of the anarchist tradition, there are other political philosophies that make alternative use of the term.  For anarchism favoring capitalist economic relations see anarcho-capitalism.

Anarchism is a generic term describing various political philosophies and social movements that advocate the elimination of all forms of social hierarchy.  In place of centralized political structures, private ownership of the means of production, and exploitative economic institutions such as rent and profit, these movements favor social relations based upon voluntary interaction and self-management, and aspire to a society characterised by autonomy and freedom. These philosophies use anarchy to mean a society based on voluntary interaction of free individuals, and the idea that communities and individuals have a say in decisions to the degree that they are affected by their outcomes.

While opposition to coercive institutions and socially constructed hierarchies are primary tenets of anarchism, anarchism is also a positive vision of how a voluntary society would work. There is considerable variation amongst anarchist philosophies. Opinions differ in various areas, such as whether violence should be employed to foster anarchism, what type of economic system should exist, questions on the environment and industrialism, and anarchists&apos; roles in other movements.

The terms &quot;anarchy&quot; and &quot;anarchism&quot; are derived from the Greek         (&quot;without archons (rulers)&quot;). Thus &quot;anarchism,&quot; in its most general meaning, is the belief that rulership is unnecessary and should be abolished. The word &quot;anarchy&quot;, as most anarchists use it, does not imply chaos or anomie, but rather a stateless society with voluntary social relations.

<h1> Precursors of anarchism </h1>

<h2>Primitive cultures</h2>
Anarcho-primitivists assert that, for the longest period before recorded history, human society was organized on anarchist principles. They point to the egalitarian structure of hunter-gatherer bands, to the lack of division of labour and accumulated wealth, and the lack of decreed law, as indicators of such primitive anarchy.

<h2>Philosophical traces</h2>
Some anarchists have embraced Taoism, which developed in Ancient China, as a source of anarchistic attitudes .  Similarly, anarchistic tendencies can be traced to the philosophers of Ancient Greece, such as  Zeno, the founder of the Stoic philosophy, and Aristippus, who said that the wise should not give up their liberty to the state .
Later movements   such as Stregheria in the 1300&apos;s, the Free Spirit in the Middle Ages,
the Anabaptists, The Diggers, and the Ranters,
  have also expounded ideas that have been interpreted as anarchist.

<h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
The first known usage of the word anarchy appears in the play Seven Against Thebes by Aeschylus, dated 467 BC. There, Antigone openly refuses to abide by the rulers&apos; decree to leave her brother Polyneices&apos; body unburied, as punishment for his participation in the attack on Thebes, saying that &quot;even if no one else is willing to share in burying him I will bury him alone and risk the peril of burying my own brother.  Nor am I ashamed to act in defiant opposition to the rulers of the city (ekhous apiston tênd anarkhian polei)&quot;.

Ancient Greece also saw the first western instance of anarchism as a philosophical ideal, in the form of the stoic philosopher Zeno of Citium, who was, according to Kropotkin, &quot;[t]he best exponent of Anarchist philosophy in ancient Greece&quot;.  As summarized by Kropotkin, Zeno &quot;repudiated the omnipotence of the state, its intervention and regimentation, and proclaimed the sovereignty of the moral law of the individual&quot;.  Within Greek philosophy, Zeno&apos;s vision of a free community without government is opposed to the state-Utopia of Plato&apos;s Republic.  Zeno argued that although the necessary instinct of self-preservation leads humans to egotism, nature has supplied a corrective to it by providing man with another instinct   sociability. Like many modern anarchists, he believed that if people follow their instincts, they will have no need of law, courts, or police, no temples and no public worship, and use no money (a gift economy taking the place of the exchanges). Zeno&apos;s beliefs have only reached us as fragmentary quotations.

<h2>The Anabaptists</h2>
The Anabaptists of 16th century Europe are sometimes considered to be religious forerunners of modern anarchism. Bertrand Russell, in his History of Western Philosophy, writes that the Anabaptists &quot;repudiated all law, since they held that the good man will be guided at every moment by the Holy Spirit...[f]rom this premise they arrive at communism....&quot; The novel Q by Luther Blissett provides a fictional depiction of this movement and its revolutionary ideology. Gerrard Winstanley of The Diggers, who published a pamphlet calling for communal ownership and social and economic organization in small agrarian communities in the 17th century, is considered another of the forerunners of modern anarchism.

<h1>History of anarchism</h1>

<h2>Justice against the state</h2>

William Godwin, in  An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; (1793) wrote what would become core anarchist critiques of government, economics, and society; though he did not use the word anarchism, some today regard him as the &quot;founder of philosophical anarchism&quot;

By &quot;political justice&quot; Godwin meant &quot;the adoption of any principle of morality and truth into the practice of a community,&quot; and his characteristically anarchist conclusion was that government in fact inhibits rather than fosters justice.

Godwin&apos;s philosophy was optimistic about the potential for human beings to develop and conduct social relations on the basis of reason and consent. He believed that there are no innate principles, and therefore no original propensity to evil. He considered that &quot;our virtues and our vices may be traced to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the world.&quot; The control of man by man in general, and the institution of government in particular, are detrimental to human development. &quot;Government by its very nature counteracts the improvement of original mind.&quot;

Godwin&apos;s masterpiece was published in 1793, in the last stages of the French Revolution. The themes of his work, some of which he later retracted, would become central to the future development of anarchism. But at this point no anarchist movement yet existed, and the term &apos;anarchiste&apos; was known only as an insult hurled by the bourgeois Girondins at more elements in the revolution. (Some of whom, the Parisian Sans-culottes, are seen by many as the immediate predecessors of working-class anarchism.)

<h2>What is property?</h2>

Pierre Proudhon (1809-1865)
It&apos;s commonly held that it wasn&apos;t until Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published &quot; What is Property?&quot; in 1840 that the term &quot;anarchist&quot; was adopted as a self-description.  It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.

In &quot; What is Property?&quot; Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;Property is theft.&quot; He opposed the institution of property (propriete) involving full &apos;rights of use and abuse&apos; as it exists in capitalism; but he supported a more limited right of &apos;possession&apos; (possession) by individuals of the means and produce of their own labour. Proudhon&apos;s vision of anarchy (which he called mutualism (mutuellisme)) thus involved a non-coercive exchange economy where individuals would trade the produce of their labour. This would be a market system without profit; goods would be traded on the basis of the labour time; a national bank would lend without interest to support production. Without property interests to protect, the state would become superfluous.

Proudhon generally opposed violent expropriation of property; instead he tended to advocate schemes (including the formation of an interest-free bank) whereby workers would create mutual organisations that could come to supplant capitalism and render the state superfluous. Proudhon&apos;s ideas began to exert some influence within French working class movements, and his followers were active in the Revolution of 1848 in France. However authoritarian socialist tendencies such as Blanquism were a stronger force in Proudhon&apos;s own time.

Proudhon&apos;s work on property raised a central issue in the future development of anarchism. The question of property, and its place in an anarchist society, is sometimes seen as dividing anarchism thereafter into two major streams or tendencies which can loosely be called &apos;individualism&apos; and &apos;collectivism&apos;.

<h2>The International - Anarchism becomes a mass movement</h2>

In Europe, a period of harsh reaction followed the widespread revolutionary activity of 1848. The next major phase of revolutionary activity began almost twenty years later with the founding of the International Workingmen&apos;s Association, sometimes called the &apos;First International, in London in 1864.

The International Workingmen&apos;s Association, at its founding, was an alliance of diverse socialist groups, including French Mutualists, English Owenites, and others. Over its short life it grew into a major movement, with local federations in many countries developing  strong bases of working class activism. But at the same  time the IWA began to polarise into two camps, with Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin as their respective figureheads.

Both sides had a stated common aim (stateless communism), and common political opponents (the ruling class). But each was critical of the other, and the conflict between the two groups intensified. Perhaps the clearest differences emerged over proposed strategies for achieving their visions of socialism. The anarchists grouped around Bakunin favoured (in Kropotkin&apos;s words) &quot;direct economical struggle against capitalism, without interfering in the political parliamentary agitation.&quot; Marxist thinking, at that time, focused on parliamentary activity. (Particularly when the new German Empire of 1871 became the first country to introduce manhood suffrage, leading many German socialists to focus their energies within the then Marxist Social Democratic Party of Germany.)

Bakunin characterised Marx&apos;s ideas as authoritarian, and predicted that if a Marxist party gained to power its leaders would end up as bad as the ruling class they had fought against (notably in his Statism and Anarchy.) In 1872, the conflict in the First International climaxed with the expulsion of Bakunin and those who had become known as the &quot;Bakuninists&quot; when they were outvoted by the Marxists at the Hague Congress. This is often cited as the origin of the long-running conflict between anarchists and Marxists. From then on, the authoritarian and libertarian currents of socialism had distinct organisations, at various points including rival &apos;internationals&apos;.

Unfortunately, many of the debates between the opposing camps became heated to the point of abusiveness. Bakunin did not restrain himself from hurling anti-German and anti-semitic slurs at Marx.

<h2>The theory of Anarchist Communism</h2>

See also: Anarchist communism

Unlike Marxism, anarchism has never had one central set of texts or authorities. But in the last three decades of the nineteenth century the anarchism of many of Bakunin&apos;s followers did gradually develop into a clearer position embracing an idea of communism.

The Italian federation of the First International, which overwhelmingly took the Bakuninist line, was the first organisation to set out an explicit vision of communist anarchism. The Italian anarchists included Carlo Cafiero, Errico Malatesta, Andrea Costa and other ex-Mazzinian Republicans. At its Florence Conference of 1876, their federation stated its principles as follows:

:&quot;The Italian Federation considers the collective property of the products of labour as the necessary complement to the collectivist programme, the aid of all for the satisfaction of the needs of each being the only rule of production and consumption which corresponds to the principle of solidarity.&quot;

In his Anarchie et Communisme, Cafiero argued that private property even in the product of labor (Mutualist &apos;possession&apos;) will lead to unequal accumulation of capital, and therefore to class distinctions.

Anarchist communists advocate an egalitarian society without markets or wages, based on the principle of &quot;from each according to their ability, to each according to need.&quot; Decisions would be made through workers councils and assemblies. There would be direct worker control of production, and self-management of community instutions. Communities, groups and workplaces would be connected together through federations and networks created by free association and popular affinity.

Perhaps the most important theorist of anarchist communism was Peter Kropotkin. In a number of works including The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, Kropotkin plotted his views of what anarchist communist society might look like and how it might be achieved. Kropotkin&apos;s anarchist communism was closely linked to his scientific theory based on evolution in which co-operation equaled or surpassed competition in importance, as illustrated in Mutual Aid: A Factor in Evolution (1897).

Subsequent figures in the theory of anarchist communism include Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman. The anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) generally saw anarchist communism as their objective. Isaac Puente&apos;s 1932 Comunismo Libertario was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for an anarchist communist society.  Most recently, groups like NEFAC (North Eastern Federation of Anarcho-Communists), have advocated various forms of anarchist communism.

Historically, anarchist communism is believed to have been put into practice by millions of people in the anarchist collectives and communes of the anarchist-controlled region of Ukraine during the Russian Revolution, and during the Spanish Civil War in the Aragon and Catalonia regions of Spain.

Anarchist communists today are involved in various broad labor and community issues; generally revolving around housing, labor struggles/strikes, anti-racism, and building the anarchist movement.  Anarchist communists have generally called for more cohesive groups and structures of anarchist groups and thereby garnered criticism from other anarchist sects. Various large-scale groups of anarchist communists exist today with the larger groups existing throughout various countries.

<h2>Individualism</h2>

See also: Individualist anarchism, mutualism, Anarchism and capitalism, Anarchist economics
Benjamin Tucker

Individualists, taking much from the writings of Max Stirner, among others, demanded the utmost respect for the liberty of the individual. While some individualists looked to natural law to justify individualism, Stirner&apos;s &quot;Egoism&quot; held that self-interest is the only legitimate justification for action.  While its roots include William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Max Stirner, it is most often associated with the American tradition of individualist anarchism, which advocates private possession (individual ownership of the &quot;full produce&quot; of one&apos;s labor) and a market economy where this property may be bought and sold.

In the United States, anarchist thoughts were expressed in the writings of Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker, and Lysander Spooner.  They espouse a labor theory of value, and, as a result, they regard profit (and thus capitalism), as being exploitative.  Wage labor is supported as long as wages adhere to the labor theory of value, hence, traditional individualists tend to advocate, and practice, an economic system called mutualism as an alternative to capitalism and communism.  The major tenets of mutualism are free association, mutualist credit, contract (or federation), and gradualism (or dual-power).  Individualists oppose property titles to unused land, arguing that land must be possessed to be legitimate property.  Individualism contrasts with collectivist forms of anarchism (anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism), and the relationships between these groups of been characterized by varying degrees of antagonism and harmony throughout their history.

Many also consider Henry David Thoreau as an individualist anarchist due to his position that individuals should not be governed and his belief that all should be free to withdraw themselves from &quot;any incorporated body.&quot;  Noteworthy anarchist writer and poet John Henry Mackay is also considered an individualist anarchist.  Contemporary individualist anarchists include Robert Anton Wilson, and Joe Peacott.

<h2>Propaganda by the deed</h2>

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts including riots, assassinations, and insurrections involving anarchists. Some revolutionaries of the late 19th century encouraged acts of political violence,  such as bombings and the assassinations of heads of state to further anarchism. Such actions have sometimes been called &apos;propaganda by the deed&apos;.

Between 1894 and 1901, individual anarchists assassinated numerous heads of state. For example, US President McKinley&apos;s assassin, Leon Czolgosz, claimed to be a disciple of Emma Goldman - although Goldman disavowed any association with him. Because international terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite, bombings were associated with anarchists, an image that remains to this day. Depictions in the press and popular fiction helped create a lasting public impression that anarchists are violent terrorists. This perception was enhanced by events such as the Haymarket Riot, where anarchists were blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in Chicago, Illinois.

The use of terrorism and assassination, however, is condemned by most anarchists. Even anarchists who see acts of violence as justified in a context of insurrection and class war would often view individual acts of terrorism as ineffective and counter-productive.

However there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence as such in the furtherance of anarchism. Mikhail Bakunin and Errico Malatesta saw violence as a necessary and sometimes desirable force. Malatesta took the view that it is &quot;necessary to destroy with violence, since one cannot do otherwise, the violence which denies [the means of life and for development] to the workers&quot; (Umanità Nova, number 125, September 6, 1921).

Other anarchists share Leo Tolstoy&apos;s Christian anarchist belief in nonviolence. These anarcho-pacifists advocate nonviolent resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution. They often see violence as the basis of government and coercion and argue that, as such, violence is illegitimate, no matter who is the target.  Some of Proudhon&apos;s French followers even saw strike action as coercive and refused to take part in such traditional socialist tactics.

Many anarchists would make a distinction between &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;property destruction&quot;: they claim that violence is when a person inflicts harm to another person, while property destruction or property damage is not violence, although it can have indirect harm such as financial harm.

<h2>Anarchism at work</h2>

See also: Anarcho-syndicalism

The red-and-black flag, coming from the experience of anarchists in the labour movement, is particularly associated with anarcho-syndicalism.

In the late 19th century, anarcho-syndicalism developed as a movement pursuing industrial actions, especially the general strike, as the primary strategy to achieve anarchist revolution, and &quot;build the new society in the shell of the old&quot;. Most anarcho-syndicalists shared a belief in anarchist communism as the best form of the future society, although not all anarchist communists agreed with syndicalism.

According to the preamble to the constitution of the US-based Industrial Workers of the World (also called IWW or Wobblies) syndicalist union:
::It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.

Anarcho-syndicalism formed a new wave of anarchism in beginning in the 1890&apos;s and 1900&apos;s. Even more than the anarchism of the International, this was anarchism brought out of the philosophy books and embodied in the ongoing struggle of millions of working class people.

After the fall of the Paris Commune in 1871 French anarchists and socialists had suffered a dark period of repression similar to the aftermath of the 1848 revolution. Anarchism began to resurface in the 1880&apos;s and 1890&apos;s, and was a particular influence upon the Bourses de Travails of autonomous workers groups and trade unions. It was from this ground that the  CGT trade union confederation, founded in 1895, was born. The CGT was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement.

CGT members Emile Pataud and Emile Pouget wrote the classic syndicalist text in 1909. The fictionalised How we will bring about the revolution (Comment nous ferons la revolution) tells the story of the birth of liberarian communism in a French general strike. However the CGT soon veered away from anarchism, and after the Russian Revolution of 1917 fell into the Communist camp. (The CGT is still an important French trade union, though now thoroughly reformist in sympathy.)

In Chicago in June 1905, a convention of two hundred socialists, anarchists, and radical trade unionists from all over the United States founded the IWW. At its peak in 1923 the organization claimed some 100,000 members in good standing, and could marshall the support of perhaps 300,000 workers.

Anarchism had been introduced into Spain by followers of Bakunin in the late 1860&apos;s, and quickly established itself as the dominant force within the Spanish socialist and working class movements. (See also - Anarchism in Spain.) Spanish anarchist trade union federations were formed in the 1870&apos;s and in 1900. But the most famous and most successful was the Confederación Nacional del Trabajo founded in 1910. The CNT was to become the major  force in Spanish working class politics - it had a membership of 1.58 million in 1934. The CNT played a major role in the Spanish Civil War (see below).

In Berlin in 1922 the CNT was amongst trade unions who joined together to form the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International.

Anarcho-syndicalist unions live on to this day, though with nothing like the strength they once enjoyed. The IWW is still active, with currently around 1000 members. After defeat in the 
Spanish Civil War, CNT members were killed, imprisoned or forced into exile. Following the death of Francisco Franco, the CNT returned to Spain. Although disputes within the movement caused an acrimonious split shortly thereafter. Other current anarcho-syndicalist organizations include the Workers Solidarity Alliance in the US, and the Solidarity Federation in the UK.

Whilst engaging in everyday workplace struggles, anarcho-syndicalist trade unions distance themselves from the methods of reformist trade unions which in their view  merely seek short-term and compromising improvements. Anarcho-syndicalism upholds principles of workers solidarity, direct action, and self-management.

Workers solidarity is the belief that all workers -- no matter what race, gender, or ethnic group -- are in a similar situation vis-à-vis their bosses.  Furthermore, within capitalism, any gains or losses made by some workers in their relation to bosses will eventually impact all workers.  Therefore, in order to gain liberation, all workers must support one another in their struggle against bosses.

Anarcho-syndicalists believe in using direct action   that is, action directly designed to confront a problem. Direct action can range from traditional strike action to active sabotage.

Furthermore, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers&apos; organizations   the organizations struggling against the wage system who, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society   should be self-managing.  They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make decisions that affect them amongst themselves.

Some critics of anarcho-syndicalism contend that its focus on proletarian class struggle overlooks the needs of segments of society such as parents or others occupied with child-rearing or domestic labor, although some anarcho-syndicalist thought attempts to address other sectors of economic life. Some primitivist authors, notably Bob Black, contend that an anarcho-syndicalist revolution would leave in place social systems they find oppressive (work and workplaces, for example), although anarcho-syndicalists contend that worker self-management would render those systems fundamentally more humane.

The anarcho-syndicalist orientation of many early American labor unions played a large part in the formation of the American political spectrum. The United States is the only industrialized former British colony to not have a labor-based political party. In Mexico, anarcho-syndicalists like Ricardo Flores Magón led various revolts and uprisings that would help overthrow the dictator Diaz, lead the way for the growth of anarchism in Latin America, and also go on to influence the modern day Zapatista rebellion.

<h3>Insurrectionary Anarchism</h3>

Insurrectionary anarchism is critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Here, Wolfi Landstreicher writes some of the basis points of its praxis.

Insurrectionary anarchism is not an ideological solution to all social problems, a commodity on the capitalist market of ideologies and opinions, but an on-going praxis aimed at putting an end to the domination of the state and the continuance of capitalism, which requires analysis and discussion to advance. We don t look to some ideal society or offer an image of utopia for public consumption. Throughout history, most anarchists, except those who believed that society would evolve to the point that it would leave the state behind, have been insurrectionary anarchists. Most simply, this means that the state will not merely wither away, thus anarchists must attack, for waiting is defeat; what is needed is open mutiny and the spreading of subversion among the exploited and excluded. Here we spell out some implications that we and some other insurrectionary anarchists draw from this general problem: if the state will not disappear on its own, how then do we end its existence? It is, therefore, primarily a practice, and focuses on the organization of attack...The State of capital will not  wither away,  attack is the refusal of mediation, pacification, sacrifice, accommodation, and compromise.
  [Landstreicher, Wolfi]

Alfredo M. Bonanno, an Italian insurrectionary anarchist also had a great impact on this specific tendency, writing such works as &quot;Armed Joy,&quot; &quot;The Anarchist Tension,&quot; and others.  In the US, Willful Disobedience, Killing King Abacus, and other magazines caused interest in insurrectionary anarchism to grow.

<h2>Anarchism and feminism</h2>

Emma Goldman 1869-1940

See also: Anarcha-Feminism

Anarcha-feminism is a kind of radical feminism that espouses the belief that patriarchy is a fundamental problem in society.  While anarchist feminism has existed for more than a hundred years, its explicit formulation as anarcha-feminism dates back to at to the early 70s , during the second-wave feminist movement.  Anarcha-feminism, views patriarchy as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.  Anarcha-feminists then conclude that if feminists are against patriarchy, they must also be against all forms of hierarchy, and therefore must reject the authoritarian nature of the state and capitalism.

Anarcho-primitivists see the creation of gender roles and patriarchy a creation of the start of civilization, and therefore consider primitivism to also be an anarchist school of thought that addresses feminist concerns.  Eco-feminism is often considered a feminist variant of green anarchist feminist thought.

Anarcha-feminism is most often associated with early 20th-century authors and theorists such as Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre, although even early first-wave feminist Mary Wollstonecraft held proto-anarchist views, and William Godwin is often considered a feminist anarchist precursor.  In the Spanish Civil War, an anarcha-feminist group, &quot;Free Women&quot;, organized to defend both anarchist and feminist ideas.

In the modern day anarchist movement, many anarchists, male or female, consider themselves feminists, and anarcha-feminist ideas are growing.  The publishing of Quiet Rumors, an anarcha-feminist reader, has helped to spread various kinds of anti-authoritarian and anarchist feminist ideas to the broader movement.

<h2>Religion</h2>
See also: Christian anarchism, Anarchism and religion
Leo Tolstoy 1828-1910
Christian anarchism is the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable, the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. Christian anarchists therefore feel that earthly authority such as government, or indeed the established church do not and should not have power over them. Christian anarchists are pacifists and oppose the use of all physical force, both proactive and reactive.

Christian anarchists believe that freedom from earthly authority will only be guided by the grace of God if individuals display compassion for others and turn the other cheek when confronted by violence.  Its adherents believe this quest for freedom is justified spiritually and quote the teachings of Jesus, some of whom are critical of the existing establishment and church. They believe all individuals can directly communicate with God and will eventually unify in peace under this one God.

The most famous advocate of Christian anarchism was Leo Tolstoy, author of The Kingdom of God is Within You, who called for a society based on compassion, nonviolent principles and freedom.

Some Christian anarchists oppose war and other statist aggression through tax resistance, while others submit to taxation. Ammon Hennacy advocated tax resistance, while Tolstoy opposed it. Tolstoy claimed that the act of resisting taxes requires physical force to withold what a government tries to take. Contrary to this Hennacy, who like Tolstoy also believed in nonresistance, managed to resist taxes without resorting to physical force. Many Christian anarchists are vegetarian or vegan.

Spiritual Anarchism, or Divine Anarchy, was originally expressed by the political revolutionary, poet and yogi Sri Aurobindo during the First World War in a series of articles published in the Arya, and later made available in two books, The Human Cycle and The Ideal of Human Unity. The exaggerations of both individualistic and communistic streams of anarchist thought are harmonized by going beyond the vital and intellectual foundations of most other schools of anarchism and rooting itself firmly in the spiritual realization and dynamic perfection of the individual and universal godhead in the race.

A spiritual anarchist holds that a perfect form of social organization can only be achieved by governing our individual and collective life by a higher light than the intellectual reason, a deeper law of solidarity and oneness than emotional or mental bonds of association.

Although it has deviated significantly from its course, the international township of Auroville was originally intended to be organized as a Divine Anarchy, and may well one day fulfill its purpose.

<h2>The Russian Revolution</h2>

The Russian Revolution of 1917 was a seismic event in the development of anarchism as a movement and as a philosophy.

Anarchists participated alongside the Bolsheviks in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict which culminated in the 1918 Kronstadt rebellion. Anarchists in central Russia were imprisoned or driven underground, or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In Ukraine anarchists fought in the civil war against both Whites and Bolsheviks within the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by Nestor Makhno).

Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman before leaving Russia were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, Bakunin&apos;s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US for example, the major syndicalist movements of the CGT and IWW began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the Communist International.

In Paris, a group of Russian anarchist exiles around Nestor Makhno concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the strutures of Bolshevism. Their manifesto known as the Platform, or the &quot;Organizational Platform of Libertarian Communists&quot;, was supported by some Anarchist Communists, but opposed by many others.

<h2>The fight against fascism</h2>

In the 1920s and 1930s the familiar dynamics of anarchism&apos;s conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of fascism in Europe. In many cases, European anarchists faced difficult choices - should they join in popular fronts with reformist democrats and Soviet-led Communists against a common fascist enemy?

Luigi Fabbri, an exile from Italian fascism, was amongst those arguing that fascism was something different:

Fascism is not just another form of government which, like all others, uses violence. It is the most authoritarian and the most violent form of government imaginable. It represents the utmost glorification of the theory and practice of the principle of authority.

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a &apos;united front&apos; policy. (see David Berry, ‘Fascism or Revolution!’ Anarchism and Antifascism in France, 1933-39*)

In Spain, the CNT initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the right responded with an attempted coup, and the Spanish Civil War was underway.

In the history of anarchism the Spanish Civil War of (1936-1939) is a defining event on at least the scale of the First International or the Russian Revolution of 1917. A widely popular anarchist movement supported by anti-fascist militias took control of the industrial stronghold of Barcelona, and rural areas mainly in northeast Spain where they collectivized the land. For a few brief months in 1936-37 libertarian communism was being put into practice.

But even before the eventual fascist victory, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the Soviet-backed communists. Whilst the CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, Communist-led troops suppressed the collectives, and the revolution was destroyed. Anarchism has never since come so close to realising the dream of libertarian communism as in that short summer of anarchy.

<h1>Contemporary anarchism</h1>

<h2>Punk rock</h2>
A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred during the 1960s and 1970s. In the UK this was associated with the punk rock movement; the band Crass is celebrated for its anarchist and pacifist ideas. In Denmark, the Freetown Christiania was created in downtown Copenhagen. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like the one still thriving in Barcelona, in Catalonia.  Militant resistance to neo-Nazi groups in places like Germany, and the uprisings of autonomous Marxism, situationist, and Autonomist groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.

For further details, see anarcho-punk

<h2>Environmentalism</h2>
See also: Green anarchism

Eco-anarchism generally is a belief in deep ecology, direct action against earth destroying institutions and systems, and generally a critique of industrial capitalism, although generally not against civilization per se.

There is a significant anarchist element to the environmental movement, including those that are known as eco-anarchists and green-anarchists. Eco-anarchism is generally a broad term that broadly refers to anarchists engaged in the earth liberation movement.  The largest segment of &apos;eco-anarchists&apos; is the Earth First! movement, a network of various collectives formed along anarchist principles.  Earth First! generally engages in direct action and eco-defense, such as tree sitting and &apos;locking down&apos;.  In the modern anarchist movement, eco-anarchists generally adhere to deep ecology, which is a worldview that embraces biodiversity and sustainability.  Eco-feminism is also sometimes considered the form of eco-anarchist feminism.

<h2>Civil rights</h2>
See also: black anarchism, APOC, ARA

Anti-Racist Action is a loose federation of groups that focus on confronting (sometimes violently) racist agitators, such as the Klu Klux Klan or neo-Nazis when they appear in public.

Black anarchism opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of color, and favors a non-hierarchical organization of society. Black anarchists, recognizing that anarchism has traditionally been European or white-based, seek to forge their own movement that represents their own identity and tailored to their own unique situation. Theorists include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Komboa Ervin, and Sam Mbah.

Anarchist People of Color was created as a forum for non-caucasian anarchists to express their thoughts about racial issues within the anarchist movement, particularly within the United States.

<h2>Globalization of capitalism</h2>

Globally, anarchism has also grown in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalization movements.  Since the late 1990s, anarchists have been known for their involvement in protests against World Trade Organization and Group of Eight meetings, and the World Economic Forum -- protests that are generally portrayed in mainstream media coverage as violent riots.  Some anarchists form black blocs at protests, in which members of the bloc wear black and cover their faces to avoid police identification and to create one large solid mass.  Bloc members confront and defend other protesters from the police, set up barricades, and sometimes engage in the destruction of corporate property.

Although black bloc anarchists are often the only visible anarchists at large protests, large-scale protests are often constructed and organized through anarchist structures. Affinity groupings, spokescouncils, and networking all have led to the success of various large-scale anti-war and anti-globalization mobilizations, most notably at the protests against the WTO Meeting of 1999 in Seattle.  Anarchists have also been involved heavily with underground direct action movements such as the Animal Liberation Front, and the Earth Liberation Front, which are considered &quot;eco-terrorist&quot; by federal authorities and some liberal organizations.  Anarchism (or at least anarchist systems of organizing) is now largely seen to have about the same sway in modern revolutionary movements as Marxism had in the 1960&apos;s.

<h2>The question of civilization</h2>

See also: anarcho-primitivism
John Zerzan

Beginning in the later part of the 20th century anarchist John Zerzan wrote in Elements of Refusal, and later, Future Primitive that civilization   not just the state   would need to fall for anarchy to be achieved. A rejection of industrial technology is also prominent in the views of many  green anarchists. This worldview was associated with the growth of the anti-roads movement in the UK, Earth First! and the Earth Liberation Front in the US, and the actions of Theodore Kaczynski (aka the &quot;Unabomber&quot;).

Primitivism is a philosophy advocating a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society, and a critique of industrial civilization, and the alienation that technology, progress, etc, have created between people and the natural world. Primitivism believes that industrial society inevitably produces oppressive structures through specialization of tasks or division of labor, and that technology has similar negative implications. Most forms of primitivism question civilization itself.  Primitivism generally sees that by the birth of agriculture, and the birth of cities and the creating of production surplus, gave rise to structures of hierarchy, and later statism.  Anarcho-primitivists point to the anti-authoritarian nature of many &apos;primitive&apos; or hunter-gatherer societies throughout the world&apos;s history, as examples of anarchist societies.

The primitivist movement has connections to radical environmentalism movements such as the Earth Liberation Front and Earth First!.

<h2>Parallel structures</h2>

See also: anarchist economics, dual-power networks

Anarchists engage in building parallel structures and organizations, such as Food Not Bombs, radical labor unions, infoshop and radical social centers, new sets of schooling systems, media in various forms, organizing around housing and land issues, and work toward accountability with police and other institutions through such tools as consensus decision-making.  This is in line with the general anarchist concept of creating &quot;dual-power&quot;, the idea of creating the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, hierarchical one.

<h2>Technology</h2>

See also: Crypto-anarchism and Cypherpunk.

Some have said that recent technological developments have made the anarchist cause both easier to advance and more conceivable to people. Public key cryptography and the Internet have made anonymous digital currencies such as e-gold an alternative to statist fiat money.  Many people use cell phones or the Internet to form loose communities that could be said to be organized along anarchist lines. Some of these communities have as their purpose the production of information in a non-commodified or use-value format, a goal made attainable by the availability of personal computing, desktop publishing, and digital media.  These things have made it possible for individuals to share music files over the Internet.  There are also open source programming communities, who donate their time and offer their product for free.  Examples include Usenet, the free software movement (including the GNU/Linux community and the wiki paradigm), and Indymedia.

Some anarchists see information technology as the way to replace hierarchy, defeat monopoly, and prevent war, and support culture jamming in particular as a way to do so. Some writers   particularly Iain M. Banks, who has written quite extensively in the science fiction genre about The Culture, a futuristic society which has disposed of government   have theorised that anarchism would be inevitable with the technological advances that would make  travelling and living in space plausible . The Electro-anarchy Collective poses a similar theory that technological power will naturally overthrow human government (although some question their anarchist credentials, claiming that technological governance is no less oppressive than human governance).

It has also been argued that the free software movement is an example of anarchic organization, this being an example not of hierarchical business, but of voluntary association for the production of a good.

<h2>Post-structuralism</h2>

See also: Post-anarchism

The term post-anarchism was originated by Saul Newman in his book &quot;From Bakunin to Lacan: Antiauthoritarianism and the Dislocation of Power&quot; to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. In this sense it has similarities with post-Marxism associated with Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffee. Subsequent to Newman&apos;s use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo have been suggested for inclusion under the rubric. Others have argued that the term &quot;poststructuralist anarchism&quot; is preferable in order to maintain an unbroken link with the anarchist heritage.

By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or shouldn&apos;t be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.

<h2>Against ideology</h2>

See also: Post-left anarchy

Post-left anarchy (also called egoist-anarchism) seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, liberals, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of ideology in general. It has rapidly developed since the fall of the Soviet Union, which many view as the death of authoritarian leftism; however, its roots are clearly visible in the ideas of the 1960s Situationists. It is not an independent &quot;movement&quot; as such but rather a critical way of thinking about anarchist ideas.

Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes (anti-war, anti-nuclear, etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. It often focuses on the individual rather than speaking in terms of class or other broad generalizations and shuns organizational tendencies in favor of the complete absence of hierarchy. Total individual liberation is a key focus, rather than merely economic liberation.

Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: CrimethInc, the magazine Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed and its editor Jason McQuinn, Bob Black, and others. For more information, see Infoshop.org&apos;s  Anarchy After Leftism section, and the  Post-left section on  anarchism.ws.

<h2>Personal practice</h2>

Small &apos;a&apos; anarchism is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts.

Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big &apos;A&apos; Anarchism in the article  Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?. While big &apos;A&apos; Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small &apos;a&apos; anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small &apos;a&apos; anarchism shares some similarities with post-left anarchy, while Neal&apos;s insistence that it entails a rejection of the idea that there can be an &quot;ultimate Truth&quot; recalls the poststructuralist turns of post-anarchism (see above).

David Graeber and Andrej Grubacic offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one&apos;s vision at the point of a gun.&quot;  Graeber and Grubacic do not offer a comprehensive list of groups within this rubric, but suggest that it includes the likes of autonomism, Zapatismo and radical democracy. It should be stressed that many of these groups do not describe themselves as &quot;anarchist&quot;, perhaps deliberately, and are grouped instead on the basis of what they do, implying that the criteria for inclusion are similar to those articulated by Neal.

It is unclear how far the term has been picked up by the wider anarchist movement, but it does help to clarify and begin to explain some of the conflicts and disagreements within contemporary anarchism.

<h1>Unsorted sections</h1>

Many of these sections down here can be merged into preceding sections, esp. the &quot;conflict&quot; discussions. Much can be deleted as it is redundant.

<h2>Conceptions of an anarchist society</h2>

See also: Anarchism and Society

Many political philosophers justify support of the state as a means of regulating violence, so that the destruction caused by human conflict is minimized and fair relationships are established. Anarchists argue that pursuit of these ends does not justify the establishment of a state, and in fact many argue that the state is incompatible with those goals. Anarchists argue that the state helps to create a monopoly on violence, and uses force and violence to expand and protect elite interests.  Much effort has been dedicated to explaining how anarchist societies would handle criminality.

<h2>Pacifism</h2>
Some anarchists consider Pacifism (opposition to war) to be inherent in their philosophy. Some anarchists take it further and follow Leo Tolstoy&apos;s belief in non-violence (note, however, that these anarcho-pacifists are not necessarily Christian anarchists as Tolstoy was), advocating non-violent resistance as the only method of achieving a truly anarchist revolution.

Anarchist literature often portrays war as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands. Many anarchists subscribe to Randolph Bourne&apos;s view that &quot;war is the health of the state&quot;. Anarchists believe that if they were to support a war they would be strengthening the state   indeed, Peter Kropotkin was alienated from other anarchists when he expressed support for the British in World War I.

Just as they are critical and distrustful of most government endeavours, anarchists often view the stated reasons for war with a cynical eye. Since the Vietnam War protests in North America and, most recently, the protests against the war in Iraq, much anarchist activity has been anti-war based.

Many anarchists in the current movement however, reject complete pacifism, (although groups like Earth First!, and Food Not Bombs are based on principles of non-violence), and instead are in favor of self-defense, and sometimes violence against oppressive and authoritarian forces which they in fact also consider as defensive violence. Anarchists are skeptical however of winning a direct armed conflict with the state, and instead concern themselves mostly with organizing. Most anarchists however, do not consider the destruction of property to be violent, as do most activists who believe in non-violence.

<h2>Parliamentarianism</h2>
While most anarchists firmly oppose voting, or otherwise participating in the State institution, there are a few that disagree.  Even hard-core anarchists (e.g. Proudhon) have succumbed to the temptation of electoral politics - and inevitably regretted it.  Voluntaryism is a anarchist school of thought which emphasizes &quot;tending your own garden&quot; and &quot;neither ballets nor bullets.&quot;  The anarchist case against voting is explained in  The Ethics of Voting by George H. Smith.

Autism is classified as a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests itself in markedly abnormal social interaction, communication ability, patterns of interests, and patterns of behavior. Although the specific etiology of autism is unknown, autism most likely results from genetically mediated vulnerability to environmental triggers.  And while these environmental factors have not yet been ascertained with scientific certainty, researchers have found at least seven major genes specifically linked to autism.  Prevalence in the United States is estimated at one child in 166, but for families that already have one autistic child, incidence is about one in twenty.  Diagnosis is based on a list of psychiatric criteria, and a series of standardized clinical tests may also be used.

Physiologically, autism may lack readily visible differences, but it is linked to abnormal biological and neurochemical development of the brain.  A complete physical and neurological evaluation will typically be part of determining a diagnosis of autism. Some now speculate that autism is in fact several distinct conditions that manifest themselves in similar ways rather than a single diagnosis.

By definition, autism must manifest delays in &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years.&quot; (DSM-IV) The ICD-10 also says that symptoms must &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; There have been large increases in the reported incidence of autism, for reasons that are heavily debated in the scientific community.

There are cases of children with autism who have improved their social and other skills to the point where they can fully participate in mainstream education and social events, but there are lingering concerns that an absolute cure from autism is impossible with current technology since it involves aspects of neurological brain structure determined very early in development. However, many autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their conditions, and see them as part of who they are.

<h1>History</h1>
Dr. Hans Asperger described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as Asperger&apos;s syndrome.

The word autism was first used in the English language by Swiss psychiatrist Eugene Bleuler in a 1912 number of the American Journal of Insanity. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word is derived from the Greek       (autos, &quot;self&quot;). When referring to a person with autism the term autistic is often used, although the term person with autism may be used instead.

However, the classification of autism did not occur until the middle of the twentieth century, when in 1943, Dr. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital studied a group of 11 children and introduced the label early infantile autism. At the same time an Austrian scientist, Dr. Hans Asperger, described a different form of autism that became known as Asperger&apos;s syndrome but the widespread recognition of Asperger&apos;s work was delayed by World War II in Germany, in fact the majority of his work wasn&apos;t officially recognised until 1997.

Thus these two conditions were described and are today listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR (fourth edition, text revision 1) as two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), more often referred to today as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of difference in communication skills, social interactions, and restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior.

Very few clinicians today solely use the DSM-IV criteria for determining a diagnosis of autism, which are based on the absence or delay of certain developmental milestones. Many clinicians instead use an alternate means (or a combination thereof) to more accurately determine a diagnosis.

<h1>Characteristics</h1>
Dr. Leo Kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in 1943.
There is a great diversity in the skills and behaviors of individuals diagnosed as autistic, and physicians will often arrive at different conclusions about the appropriate diagnosis. Much of this is due to the sensory system of an autistic which is quite different from the sensory system of other people, since certain stimulations can affect an autistic differently than a non-autistic, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected varies wildly from one autistic person to another.

Nevertheless, professionals within pediatric care and development often look for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible.  However, some people do not believe in treatment for autism, either because they do not believe autism is a disorder or because they believe treatment can do more harm than good.

<h2>Social development</h2>
Typically, developing infants are social beings early in life they do such things as gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp a finger, and even smile. In contrast, most autistic children prefer objects to faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in the give-and-take of everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many seem indifferent to other people because they avoid eye contact and do not interact with them as often as unautistic children.

Autistic children often appear to prefer being alone rather than in the company of others and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents&apos; displays of anger or affection in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment is unusual and difficult to interpret. Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected attachment behavior.

Autistic children appear to lack &quot;theory of mind&quot;, the ability to see things from another person&apos;s perspective, a behavior cited as exclusive to human beings above the age of five and, possibly, other higher primates such as adult gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Typical 5-year-olds can develop insights into other people&apos;s different knowledge, feelings, and intentions, interpretations based upon social cues (e.g., gestures, facial expressions). An individual with autism seems to lack these interpretation skills, an inability that leaves them unable to predict or understand other people&apos;s actions. The social alienation of autistic and Asperger&apos;s people is so intense from childhood that many of them have imaginary friends as companionship. However, having an imaginary friend is not necessarily a sign of autism and also occurs in non-autistic children.

Although not universal, it is common for autistic people to not regulate their behavior. This can take the form of crying or verbal outbursts that may seem out of proportion to the situation. Individuals with autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments; they may react negatively to them being changed.  It is not uncommon for individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations.

<h2>Sensory system</h2>
A key indicator to clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would include looking for symptoms much like those found in sensory integration dysfunction. Children will exhibit problems coping with the normal sensory input. Indicators of this disorder include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behaviour; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in speech, language or motor skills; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement.

One common example is an autistic&apos;s hearing. The autistic may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are louder than usual. Or the autistic may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see cocktail party effect). However, this is perhaps the part of the autism that tends to vary the most from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic.

<h2>Communication difficulties</h2>
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; Speech development in autistics takes different paths.  Some autistics remain mute throughout their lives while being fully literate and able to communicate in other ways images, sign language, and typing are far more natural to them. Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the teenage years.  Still, inability to speak does not mean that autistics are unintelligent or unaware.  Once given appropriate accommodations, many will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online chat rooms, discussion boards or websites and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as Autreat.

Those who do speak often use language in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives.  Some speak only single words, while others repeat the same phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called echolalia.  Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in.  Many autistics have a strong tonal sense, and can often understand spoken language better if it is sung to them.

Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large vocabularies, but have great difficulty in sustaining typical conversations.  The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a monologue on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot; taking turns expressing views and information.  Just as non-autistics have trouble understanding autistic body languages, vocal tones, or phraseology, autistics similarly have trouble with such things in non-autistics.  In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; non-autistics often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what autistics say or expect the autistic to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

The body language of autistics can be difficult for non-autistics to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other autistics, but do not match those used by non-autistics. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the non-autistic&apos;s auditory system often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, robot-like voice is common in autistic children. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistics are often unfamiliar with the autistic body language, and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let non-autistics know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, autistics do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed.

<h2>Repetitive behaviors</h2>
Although autistics usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;stimming,&quot; may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for pretend play. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route can be extremely disturbing. Autistics sometimes have a persistent, intense preoccupation. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about vacuum cleaners, train schedules or lighthouses. Often they show great interest in numbers, symbols or science topics.

<h1> DSM definition </h1>
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): 
##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction 
###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level 
###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) 
###lack of social or emotional reciprocity 
##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime) 
###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others 
###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language 
###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level
##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: 
###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus 
###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals 
###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements) 
###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play. 
#The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett&apos;s Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual &apos; s diagnostic criteria in general is controversial for being vague and subjective.  (See the DSM cautionary statement.) The criteria for autism is much more controversial and some clinicians today may ignore it completely, instead solely relying on other methods for determining the diagnosis.

<h1> Types of autism </h1> 
Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly dysfunctional and apparently mentally handicapped to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to the general public. In terms of both classification and therapy, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an IQ 80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ 80 are referred to as having &quot;high-functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to IQ.  The terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels.

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all, because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible.

As a consequence, many &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic persons, and autistic people with a relatively high IQ, are underdiagnosed, thus making the claim that &quot;autism implies retardation&quot; self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics.

<h2> Asperger&apos;s and Kanner&apos;s syndrome </h2>
Asperger described his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.
In the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner&apos;s) and Asperger&apos;s syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;[d]elays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play[,]&quot;   [  #endnote_bnat]   while a diagnosis of Asperger&apos;s syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot; in these areas.   [  #endnote_bnas]

The DSM makes no mention of level of intellectual functioning, but the fact that Asperger&apos;s autistics as a group tend to perform better than those with Kanner&apos;s autism has produced a popular conception that Asperger&apos;s syndrome is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism,&quot; or that it is a lesser disorder than autism.  There is also a popular but not necessarily true conception that all autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning have Asperger&apos;s autism or that both types are merely geeks with a medical label attached. Also, autism has evolved in the public understanding, but the popular identification of autism with relatively severe cases as accurately depicted in Rain Man has encouraged relatives of family members diagnosed in the autistic spectrum to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger&apos;s syndrome rather than autism.

<h2>Autism as a spectrum disorder</h2>
:For more details on this topic, see Autistic spectrum.

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as autistic spectrum disorders.  A related continuum is Sensory Integration Dysfunction, which is about how well we integrate the information we receive from our senses.  Autism, Asperger&apos;s syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

There are two main manifestations of classical autism, regressive autism and early infantile autism.  Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins at approximately 18 months.  This is a source of some controversy as to when the neurological difference involved in autism truly begin.

<h1>Models</h1>
Similar to the causes and origins of autism and Asperger&apos;s syndrome, the model of what autism really is brings its own continuing conjecture and debate. Amongst several competing theories are the underconnectivity theory  [  #endnote_cmuut]   developed by cognitive scientists at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, the Neanderthal theory  [  #endnote_rdosnt]  , Simon Baron-Cohen&apos;s extreme male brain theory, the lack of theory of mind, and the preoperational-autism theory.

*The extreme male brain theory
The extreme male brain theory of autism, proposed by Simon Baron-Cohen in accordance with his empathizing-systemizing theory  [  #endnote_guardianest]  , suggests that autistics have extreme forms of what he describes as the male brain: they are good (often very good) at systemizing, and very bad at empathizing. Poetry composed by autistics  [  #endnote_atpoetry]   would seem to challenge this idea, but the scientific validity of the idea is still under discussion.
*The preoperational-autism theory
The preoperational-autism theory states that autistic people are those who become neurologically impeded at the preoperational stage of cognitive development, where much of information processing is at a holistic-visual level and largely musical and nonverbal. This also addresses the issue of the theory of mind where children (autistic and non-autistic) at the preoperational stage of cognitive development have not attained decentralization from egocentrism.
*Monotropism
In this model of mind, mental events compete for and consume attention. In a polytropic mind, many interests have a moderate amount of  attention put into them, while in a monotropic mind, the person&apos;s attention is put into a few more specialized interests. The theory argues that when many interests are aroused, multiple complex behaviors emerge, but if only a few interests are aroused, fewer but more intense behaviors emerge.  A May 2005 article in The Autism Journal   [  #endnote_autismmonothropism]   and information available from the group Autism and Computing  [  #endnote_AandC]   delves further into this subject.
*Underconnectivity theory
Underconnectivity theory theorizes that autism is a system-wide brain disorder that limits the coordination and integration among brain areas. With the aid of fMRI, it was seen that white matter, which connects various areas of the brain like cables, has abnormalities in people with autism. 
This theory may be related to the &quot;lack of central coherence&quot; theory proposed by Uta Frith, which suggests that children with autism are good at paying attention to detail but have difficulty integrating information from a range of sources.
*Mind blindness theory
This theory says that the autistic person has &quot;mind blindness&quot;, or the inability to create models of other people&apos;s thoughts. The typical example of this is the Sally-Anne test where the subjects have to try to determine what a third party&apos;s action will be (see theory of mind also). Some autistics do not seem to fit this model, however.
*Faulty mirror neuron theory
In some instances, brain areas that are active during the observation of hand-movements
are silent in autistic individuals . The activity
is markedly enhanced in non-autistic persons. So the social deficits observed in
autism could be the result of a faulty mirror neuron system, which could also
prevent normal development of empathy.
*Social construct theory
This is the belief that autism is not really a disorder, but instead is a social construct.  That is, supporters of this theory do not believe autism exists at all; they believe (partly supported by recent reference to the rising cases of diagnosed autism) that autism is just the way some people are that is, a part of the person&apos;s personality, which might explain the apparent difficulty in finding a model and a cure. This is further supported by the fact that autistic people have normal lifespans and their condition often comes with advantages, not just disadvantages.
*Genetics theory
Research done by some institutions seek to find a way for early and more accurate detection of autism similar to Rett syndrome.  Instead of searching for one particular gene as the cause for autism, many of the studies tend to search for complex interactions between a number of genes.

A 2005 study done by the Duke Center for Human Genetics at Duke University finds some evidence that complex interactions between GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) receptor genes might be part of the cause of autism.  One of the functions of the GABA genes is to inhibit the nerve system from firing. The theory is that somehow GABA genes suffer damage of some kind, leading to an overwhelmed sensory system causing the characteristics or symptoms of autism.  [  #endnote_dukegeneticspressrelease]  ,  [  #endnote_dukegenetics]

<h1> Epidemiology </h1>
While the epidemiology of autism is largely unknown, there is no shortage of theories in the area.  In addition, in recent times the number of diagnosed incidents of autism has risen dramatically.

<h2> Theories of the etiology of autism </h2>
*Brain testosterone theory
Simon Baron-Cohen proposes a model for autism based in his empathising-systemising (E-S) theory  [  #endnote_guardianest2]  .  His team at the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, UK, measured testosterone levels in the amniotic fluid of mothers while pregnant. This is presumed to reflect levels in the babies themselves. The team found that the babies with higher fetal testosterone levels had a smaller vocabulary and made eye contact less often when they were a year old.

His group has looked at the original 58 children again, at age four. The researchers found that the children with higher testosterone in the womb are less developed socially, and the interests of boys are more restricted than girls. The results are published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in a 2004 issue   [  #endnote_BaronCohen2004CPP]  .

Baron-Cohen theorizes that high fetal testosterone levels push brain development towards an improved ability to see patterns and analyze systems. Males supposedly tend to be better at these tasks than females. But the high levels are thought to inhibit the development of communication and empathy, which are allegedly typical female skills. (New Scientist, May 24 2003)   [  #endnote_BaronCohen2003NS]  .

However, there is still no demonstrable evidence that testosterone levels affect brain development or autism. Gender or biodeterminism is a fashionable explanation for many human behaviors, but has been challenged by other professionals  [  #endnote_bttchallenge]  .

*Vaccine theory 
Controversial research by Andrew Wakefield in the UK that was published in The Lancet in the February 1998 issue, dubbed the &quot;Wakefield Study&quot;, suggested a possible link between autism and the MMR vaccine.  The original research has come under criticism, largely due to an alleged conflict of interest on Wakefield&apos;s part   [  #endnote_Wakefieldconflict]  , rather than the reliability of the study results.

Critics have claimed that Wakefield&apos;s study contains many obvious flaws, including an inability to recognize bias in his sample, and 12 of the original 14 authors of the paper retracted a controversial conclusion of the study, that further research into possible triggers, such as MMR, should be undertaken.  The co-authors did not retract Wakefield&apos;s discovery of autistic enterocolitis as a completely new syndrome, which has now been replicated in studies around the world as a new, unexplained disease in patients with autism.  In October, 2005, a study by the respected Cochrane Library said, on the basis of 31 pieces of research into the possible side effects of MMR, that it found no association between MMR and autism.  It also said that no fewer than nine of the most celebrated studies used against him were unreliable in the way they were constructed, add that their conclusion MMR was &apos;safe&apos; or &apos;well-tolerated&apos; needs to be &apos;interpreted with caution&apos;.  Controversy continues, with Wakefield continuing to defend his theory.

Although allegations that Wakefield study is flawed does not in itself prove that no autism-vaccine connection exists, his critiics vigorously suggest that the theory may be false.  Several independent groups, including the National Academy of Sciences, have conducted thorough investigations into the possible link and concluded that the evidence does not support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism.

One study by Gillberg and Heijbel in 1998 examining the prevalence of autism in children born in Sweden from 1975 to 1984  [  #endnote_gillbergheijbel]   found  no difference in the prevalence of autistic children born before the introduction of the MMR vaccine in Sweden and those born after the vaccine was introduced.  Another study, conducted by Madsen and other researchers in 2002, studied all children born in Denmark from January 1991 through December 1998  [  #endnote_madsenetal]  . There were a total of 537,303 children in the study; 440,655 of the children were vaccinated with MMR and 96,648 were not. The researchers did not find a higher risk of autism in the vaccinated than in the unvaccinated group of children.

Research in the U.S. has suggested a similar link between autism and the DPT vaccine. However, unlike early claims from Wakefield, it is doubtful that a large majority of autism cases would come from this vaccine. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, controversy surrounding autism and vaccines continues to this day, and many polls, such as the autism coach poll  [  #endnote_autismcoachpoll]  , which involved only 15 respondents, show vaccines as the most popular theory currently on the etiology of autism among parents of autistic children.

In a controversial article in June 2005, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. described research suggesting that it is not the vaccines themselves, but a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal, used in some vaccine preparations (although not MMR), that may be a cause of autism  [  #endnote_kennedythimerosal]  . Kennedy argues that autism was first observed in children who were born around the time of introduction of thimerosal into mass-produced vaccines, and that the incidence of autism in the United States is well correlated with the amounts of thimerosal children receive during their first two years of life. However, the CDC has described a link between thimerosal and autism as &apos;unlikely&apos;.

In 1999 the Public Health Service (including the CDC, FDA, and NIH) recommended that thimerosal no longer be used in vaccine preparations. And while thimerosal is now utilized in only a very few childhood vaccines, it has not been established that autism rates have dropped significantly. The CDC and most medical organizations have gone to great lengths to discredit this theory of autism. However, the California Department of Developmental Services (DDS), considered to have the best reporting system for autism in the US, released in late 2005 indicating an unprecedented decline in new cases of professionally diagnosed, full syndrome DSM IV autism entering the DDS system, from 734 new cases during the second quarter of 2005 to 678 new cases during the third quarter of 2005, a 7 1/2% decline in one quarter.  The modest, but statistically significant decline coincides with vaccines containing thimerosal being phased out in recent years.

*Brain trauma
Susan Bryson has claimed that some autistics have evidence of trauma to the brain stem in early development, and that a small portion of the thalidomide victims have become autistic. The victims&apos; limbs were normal unless thalidomide use continued later in the pregnancy. The brain stem anomaly&apos;s most striking feature is inability to focus attention away from a stimulus in a short time like neurotypicals, as demonstrated in a psychological test.

Some people claim the inability to shift attention quickly interferes with the ability to read nonverbal language where fast attention shifts are needed (such as eye language), suggesting that being nonverbal is not a primary feature of autism. Strong and shiftless focus is, however, a benefit in some areas like science, programming, and advanced mathematics. This is supported by the monotropism hypothesis.

Dr. Bernard Rimland&apos;s influential research and his book Infantile Autism (1967) argued that autism was not caused by childhood trauma or abuse, but by damage to certain areas of the brain, particularly the reticular formation which associates present sensory input with memories of past experiences. Dr. Rimland is a foremost advocate of the theory that autism may be precipitated by mercury and heavy metal toxicity  [  #endnote_curezonemercury]  . He also is prominent in increasingly common claims of successful treatment of autism in children particularly regarding improvements in ability to comprehend the spoken word with the gluten-free, casein-free diet and mercury chelation therapy.

Others claim Dr. Bernard Rimland&apos;s methods alleviate the symptoms of heavy metal poisoning, but not autism. Curing heavy metal poisoning when it is present is a worthy goal (it helps with IQ and other learning difficulties as well as general health), but claiming a benefit for autism is a misrepresentation. Heavy metal poisoning may be more common among autistics due to a severe metallothionein deficiency, but more evidence is needed to substantiate the idea that heavy metals cause autism. It is still being studied. The presence of heavy metals, particularly mercury, might make an autism diagnosis more likely, however.

*Viral or bacterial infection
A growing body of peer-reviewed studies published in mainstream journals has shown that many common diseases of previously unknown origin are caused by the presence of slowly acting viruses.  For example, cervical cancer is caused by the human papilloma wart virus; some cases of liver cancer are caused by hepatitis C or B; Schizophrenia may be caused by Borna virus. Paul W. Ewald, among others, argues that the available data on the origin of autism is consistent with it being caused by a virus or infection.

<h2> Increase in diagnoses of autism </h2>
:For more details on this topic, see Autism epidemic.

The number of reported cases of autism has increased dramatically over the past decade. Statistics in graph from the National Center for Health Statistics.
There has been an explosion worldwide in reported cases of autism over the last ten years, which is largely reminiscent of increases in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder in the twentieth century. This has brought rise to a number of different theories as to the nature of the sudden increase.

Epidemiologists argue that the rise in diagnoses in the United States is partly or entirely attributable to changes in diagnostic criteria, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services. A widely cited study from the M.I.N.D. Institute in California (October 17 2002), claimed that the increase in autism is real, even after those complicating factors are accounted for (see reference in this section below).

Other researchers remain unconvinced (see references below), including Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio and cochair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Autism Expert Panel, who says, &quot;There is a chance we&apos;re seeing a true rise, but right now I don&apos;t think anybody can answer that question for sure.&quot; (Newsweek reference below).

The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a real increase would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while little or no real increase would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (vaccination, diet, societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution. There is little public research on the effects of in vitro fertilization on the number of incidences of autism.

One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism.  This is hinted, for instance, by a Wired Magazine article in 2001 entitled &quot;The Geek Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement  [  #endnote_Wired]  .  This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media&apos;s application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger&apos;s syndrome. See clinomorphism for further discussion of this issue.

Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of independent adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger&apos;s syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children&apos;s diagnoses. Because autism falls into the pervasive developmental disorder category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a differential diagnosis.

<h1> Remediation </h1>
There are many different therapies and treatments but the success they have varies dramatically from person to person. Remediation of the debilitating aspects of autism is also hindered by widespread disagreement over its nature and causes, and by a lack of recognized and effective therapies.

The behavioral and cognitive functioning of individuals with autism might improve with the help of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions. Among psychosocial treatments, intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life might increase the ability of children with autism to acquire language and the ability to learn. In adults with autism, some studies have found beneficial effects of the antidepressant medications clomipramine and fluoxetine and the antipsychotic medication haloperidol. In many cases quite a few medications will have to be tried until a successful drug is found, and the drug may lose effectiveness later in life, complicating matters further.

Dr. Bruno Bettelheim believed that autism was linked to early childhood trauma, and his work was highly influential for decades.  Parents, especially mothers, of autistics were blamed for having caused their child&apos;s condition through the withholding of affection. Leo Kanner, who first described autism (Autistic disturbances of affective contact, 1943) originated the &quot;refrigerator mother&quot; hypothesis, which held that autism was at least partly caused by a lack of affection from the mother. Although Kanner eventually renounced the concept and apologized publicly, Bettelheim took the theory further. These theories did nothing to address the fact that having more than one autistic child in a family is exceptional, not the rule.  Treatments based on these theories failed to help autistic children.

<h2>Applied Behavior Analysis</h2>
A major breakthrough (in some respects) in the remediation of autistic behaviors came through work spearheaded by Ole Ivar Lovaas, who believed that success could be obtained by behavioral approaches.

:Lovaas&apos; approaches often referred to as Discrete Trial, Intensive Behavior Intervention, and Applied Behavior Analysis are some of the best known and most widely used in the field and focus on the development of attention, imitation, receptive or expressive language, and pre-academic and self-help skills. Using a one-to-one therapist-child ratio and the &quot;antecedent-behavior-consequence&quot; (ABC) model, interventions based on this work involve trials or tasks. Each consists of (a) an antecedent, which is a directive or request for the child to perform an action; (b) a behavior, or response from the child, which may be categorized as successful performance, noncompliance, or no response; and (c) a consequence, defined as the reaction from the therapist, which ranges from strong positive reinforcement to a strong negative response, &quot;No!&quot;(Autism Society of America, 2001)  [  #endnote_aanaba]  .

Lovaas&apos; Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) methods were the first scientifically validated therapy for autism.  Early intervention, generally before school-age, seems to be critical to achieving optimal outcomes.

ABA techniques based on B. F. Skinner&apos;s Verbal Behavior have succeeded in helping nonverbal children start to talk, typically going from zero words to several dozen.  By allowing children to express their needs, even rudimentary speech can alleviate frustration and tantrums.

The scientific validity of Lovaas&apos;s methods is questioned by many professionals as well as parents and autistics themselves. Lovaas&apos;s initial studies looked promising but have not been reproduced by others with the same rate of success. There have not been any double-blind studies that
validate ABA, so it is unclear if any improvements seen in children are simply due to their normal course of development.

Many also feel that there are serious ethical problems, and point out that early ABA was based around the use of aversives which could be experienced by an autistic person as confusing and painful   [  #endnote_sentexaba]  . Most contemporary behaviorist programs for autistics employ no aversiveness at all, and not all attempt to &quot;extinguish&quot; behaviors such as rocking or spinning that autistics use for calming purposes.

ABA may not be appropriate for every autistic or developmentally delayed child. ABA has come into widespread use only in the last decade and the demand is outstripping the supply of committed and experienced service providers. As a result, parents of children need to be extra vigilant in choosing appropriate treatments for their children and especially in choosing providers, who may be inexperienced, use questionable methods or even deceive parents that they are competent to run an ABA or any other program. Such problems have led to horror stories from some parents.   [  #endnote_abahorror1]     [  #endnote_abahorror2]

<h2>Relationship Development Intervention</h2>
Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) is a research-based treatment program developed by Dr. Steven E. Gutstein.  Whereas ABA aims to teach social skills directly, RDI focuses on building the &quot;dynamic intelligence&quot; that underlies the acquisition of those social skills in neurotypical children.  It also focuses on the building blocks of motivation by developing episodic memory (seen as impaired in autism) and filling it with the child&apos;s own personal stories of competence and mastery.  RDI emphasizes declarative (as opposed to imperative) communication, and aims for an appropriate balance of verbal and nonverbal communication.

Dr. Gutstein claims that 70% of his patients improved their ADOS score within 18 months, which is unprecedented (it was previously thought that improvement on the ADOS was impossible), and that a similar proportion are able to enter school without a shadow teacher or other personal assistant.
<h2>Son-Rise</h2>
The Son-Rise program was developed by Samahria &amp; Barry Neil Kaufman, who founded the Option Institute to promulgate their more general philosophy upon which the Son-Rise program is partially based, and to provide training in this treatment approach. It is a home-based program with emphasis on eye contact, accepting the child without judgment, and engaging the child in a noncoercive way. The Association for Science in Autism Treatment (ASAT)  [  #endnote_asatonline]   maintains a Description of the Son-Rise Program  [  #endnote_asatsonrise]  .
<h2>Autism and computing</h2>
Many studies have shown that computers help calm autistic children and help them communicate,  [  #endnote_atcomputerstudy]   and that often autistic children take to computers more quickly than non-autistic people.  However, evidence suggesting that computers help autistic children communicate without computers is less promising, and autistic children are not immune to the effects of overuse of computers. One can deduce from this that autistic children often communicate better through e-mail than normal speech, but in rare cases the reverse can be true also.

Some groups have proposed more precise scientific reasons for why this happens. One such group, the nonprofit Autism and Computing  [  #endnote_AandC2]  , claims that autism is monotropism (as stated in an above section), and they argue that computers provide an easy way of joining attention tunnels (a.k.a. undivided attention) with minimal discomfort, circumventing some of the most disabling features of autistic spectrum disorders.

<h2>Gluten-free, casein-free diet</h2>
Dr. Karl Ludwig Reichelt claims to have found peptides from casein and gluten that worsen the symptoms of autistic children. These peptides are casomorphines and gluten exorphines, which influence the brain. According to Dr. Reichelt, significant improvement has been seen in the symptoms of some of his patients with autism who had been put on a diet that omits these peptides. The diet is called the gluten-free, casein-free diet.  Some physicians see diet as a central part of the treatment, but in addition to many other treatments at the same time  [  #endnote_awwhatisdan]  .

<h1>Sociology</h1>
Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of sociology that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture possible with it.  In addition, there are several communities being formed within the autistic community, and in recent times they have become a bit polarized.

<h2>Community</h2>
:For more details on this topic, see Autistic community.

Much like many other controversies in the world, the autistic community itself has splintered off into several groups.  Essentially, these groups are those who seek a cure for autism, dubbed pro-cure, those who do not desire a cure for autism and as such resist it, dubbed anti-cure, and the many people caught in the middle of the two.  In recent history, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to a cure, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement sent a letter to the United Nations demanding to be treated as a minority group rather than a group with a mental disability or disease. Websites such as  autistics.org present the view of the anti-cure group.

There are numerous resources available for autistics from many groups.  Due to the fact that many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, many of these resources are available online.  In addition, sometimes successful autistic adults in a local community will help out children with autism, much in the way a master would help out an apprentice, for example.

2002 was declared Autism Awareness Year in the United Kingdom this idea was initiated by Ivan and Charika Corea, parents of an autistic child, Charin. Autism Awareness Year was led by the British Institute of Brain Injured Children,  Disabilities Trust,  National Autistic Society,  Autism London and 800 organizations in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of British Prime Minister  Tony Blair and parliamentarians of all parties in the Palace of Westminster.

<h2>Culture</h2>
:For more details on this topic, see Autistic culture. 
With the recent increases in autism rates, an autistic culture has begun to develop.  Autistic culture is much akin to deaf culture, which says that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured, i.e., &quot;anti-cure&quot;.  There are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture, not just &quot;autistic culture&quot;.

It is a common misperception that people with autism do not marry; many do get married.  Often, it is to another person with autism, although this is not always the case.  Many times this is due to shared interests or obsessions, but more often than not it is due to more compatibility with personality types.  Multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more common.

Interests with autistic people and so-called &quot;geeks&quot; or &quot;nerds&quot; can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects much like the variant normal behavior geeks experience.  However, in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups, which impairs them even in the most &quot;technical&quot; of situations.

<h2>Autistic adults</h2>

Some autistic adults are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, usually those with high-functioning autism or Asperger&apos;s syndrome. Nevertheless, communication and social programs often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic&apos;s life. Other autistics are capable of employment in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives. Some argue that the internet allows autistic individuals to communicate and form online communities, in addition to being able to find occupations such as independent consulting, which does generally not require much human interaction offline.

In the United States, the public schools&apos; responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is in their 20s, depending on each state. The family is then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match the particular needs of their adult child, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

<h2> Autistic savants </h2>
The autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people. The term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study.  Although there is a common association between savants and autism (an association created by the 1988 film Rain Man), most autistic people are not savants. Calendar calculators and fast programming skills are the most common form. The famous example is Daniel Tammet, the subject of the documentary film The Brain Man   [  #endnote_guardianbrainman]   (Kim Peek, one of the inspirations for Dustin Hoffman&apos;s character in the film Rain Man, is not autistic). &quot;Bright Splinters of the Mind&quot; is a book that explores this issue further.

<h1> Other pervasive developmental disorders </h1>
Autism and Asperger&apos;s syndrome are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The three other pervasive developmental disorders are Rett syndrome, Childhood disintegrative disorder, and Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Some of the these are related to autism, while some of them are entirely seperate conditions.

<h2> Rett syndrome </h2>
Rett syndrome is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl&apos;s mental and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these early symptoms may be confused for autism. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with a 80% accuracy rate   [  #endnote_nihrett]  . Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett syndrome is a developmental disorder and not part of the autistic spectrum   [  #endnote_brighttotsrett]  .

<h2>Childhood disintegrative disorder</h2>
Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD, and sometimes abbreviated as CHDD also) is a condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months, the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language functioning from previously normal behaviour.  This long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system   [  #endnote_yalecdd]     [  #endnote_nihcdd]  .

<h2>  Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified </h2>
Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, or PDD-NOS, is referred to as a subthreshold condition because it is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders, PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all. Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an official diagnosis   [  #endnote_yalepddnos]  .

The albedo is a measure of reflectivity of a surface or body. It is the ratio of electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation) reflected to the amount incident upon it. The fraction, usually expressed as a percentage from 0% to 100%, is an important concept in climatology and astronomy. This ratio depends on the frequency of the radiation considered: unqualified, it refers to an average across the spectrum of visible light. It also depends on the angle of incidence of the radiation: unqualified, normal incidence. Fresh snow albedos are high: up to 90%. The ocean surface has a low albedo. Earth has an average albedo of 31% whereas the albedo of the Moon is about 12%. In astronomy, the albedo of satellites and asteroids can be used to infer surface composition, most notably ice content.    Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. The next highest albedo belongs to Alex.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease global warming.

The &quot;classical&quot; example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback. If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of insolation; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

<h1> Some examples of albedo effects </h1>

<h2> Fairbanks, Alaska </h2>

According to the National Climatic Data Center&apos;s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at Fairbanks, Alaska, is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late winter months, when solar radiation is greater.

<h2> The tropics </h2>

Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more snow falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When Brazilian ranchers cut down dark, tropical rainforest trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round.

<h2> Small scale effects </h2>

Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of heatstroke than those who wear white clothes.

<h2> Pine forests </h2>

The albedo of a pine forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean&apos;s albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense swampland averages between 9% and 14%. Deciduous trees average about 13%. A grassy field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A desert or large beach usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand. [Reference: Edward Walker&apos;s study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N].

<h2> Urban areas </h2>

Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

<h2> Trees </h2>

Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to (increase albedo and thereby) cool (?) the planet. Cloud feedbacks further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming .

<h2> Snow </h2>

Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over Antarctica they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo feedback). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of global warming.

<h2> Clouds </h2>

Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s. Climate models have shown that if the whole Earth were to be suddenly covered by white clouds, the surface temperatures would drop to a value of about -150 °C (-240 °F). This model, though it is far from perfect, also predicts that to offset a 5 °C (9 °F) temperature change due to an increase in the magnitude of the greenhouse effect, &quot;all&quot; we would need to do is increase the Earth&apos;s overall albedo by about 12% by adding more white clouds.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the September 11 attacks, after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1  C increase in the diurnal temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (see: contrail).

<h2> Aerosol effects </h2>

Aerosol (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as CCNs and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain .

<h2> Black carbon </h2>

Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the IPCC say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m -2  (from +0.1 W m -2  in the SAR)) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m -2 &quot;. .

Abu Dhabi (Arabic:         Ab   aby) is the largest of the seven emirates that comprise the United Arab Emirates and was also the largest of the former Trucial States. Abu Dhabi is also a city of the same name within the Emirate that is the capital of the country, in north central UAE.  The city lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the Persian Gulf from the central western coast. An estimated 1,000,000 lived there in 2000, with about an 80% expatriate population. Abu Dhabi city is located at  } 24.4667° N 54.3667° E
. Al Ain is Abu Dhabi&apos;s second largest urban area with a population of more than 200,000 and located 150 kilometres inland.

<h1> History </h1>

Parts of Abu Dhabi were settled as far back as the 3rd millennium B.C. and its early history fits the nomadic, herding and fishing pattern typical of the broader region. Modern Abu Dhabi traces its origins to the rise of an important tribal confederation the Bani Yas in the late 18th century, who also assumed control of Dubai. In the 19th century the Dubai and Abu Dhabi branches parted ways.

Into the mid-20th century, the economy of Abu Dhabi continued to be sustained mainly by camel herding, production of dates and vegetables at the inland oases of Al Ain and Liwa, and fishing and pearl diving off the coast of Abu Dhabi city, which was occupied mainly during the summer months.  Most dwellings in Abu Dhabi city were, at this time constructed of palm fronds (barasti), with the better-off families occupying mud huts.  The growth of the cultured pearl industry in the first half of the 20th century created hardship for residents of Abu Dhabi as pearls represented the largest export and main source of cash earnings.

In 1939, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Dhiyab granted Petroleum concessions, and oil was first found in 1958.  At first, oil money had a marginal impact.  A few lowrise concete buildings were erected, and the first paved road was completed in 1961, but Sheikh Shakbut, uncertain whether the new oil royalties would last, took a cautious approach, prefering to save the revenue rather than investing it in development.  His brother, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan, saw that oil wealth had the potential to transform Abu Dhabi.  The ruling Al Nahayan family decided that Sheikh Zayed should replace his brother as Ruler and carry out his vision of developing the country.  On August 6, 1966, with the assistance of the British, Sheikh Zayed became the new ruler.  See generally, Al-Fahim, M, From Rags to Riches: A Story of Abu Dhabi, Chapter Six (London Centre of Arab Studies, 1995), ISBN 1 900404 00 1.

With the announcement by Britain in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Gulf area by 1971, Sheikh Zayed became the main driving force behind the formation of the United Arab Emirates.

After the Emirates gained independence in 1971, oil wealth continued to flow to the area and traditional mud-brick huts were rapidly replaced with banks, boutiques and modern highrises.

<h1> Current Ruler </h1>
His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan is the hereditary emir and ruler of Abu Dhabi, as well as the current president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

<h1> Postal History </h1>

Now part of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi was formerly the largest of the seven sheikdoms which made up the Trucial States on the so-called Pirate Coast of eastern Arabia between Oman and Qatar.  The Trucial States as a whole had an area of some 32,000 square miles of which Abu Dhabi alone had 26,000.  The capital was the town of Abu Dhabi which is on an offshore island and was first settled in 1761.

The name Trucial States arose from treaties made with Great Britain in 1820 which ensured a condition of truce in the area and the suppression of piracy and slavery.  The treaty expired on December 31 1966.  The decision to form the UAE was made on July 18 1971 and the federation was founded on 1 August 1972, although the inaugural UAE stamps were not issued until 1 January 1973.

Oil production began on Das Island after prospecting during 1956-1960.  Das Island is part of Abu Dhabi but lies well offshore, about 100 miles north of the mainland.  Oil production on the mainland began in 1962.  As a major oil producer, Abu Dhabi soon acquired massive financial wealth.  Investment in long-term construction projects and the establishment of a finance sector has led to the area becoming a centre of commerce which may well secure its lasting importance when the oil resources are exhausted.

In December 1960, postage stamps of British Postal Agencies in Eastern Arabia were supplied to the construction workers on Das Island but the postal service was administered via the agency office in Bahrain.  The mail was also postmarked Bahrain so there was no clear indication that a letter had come from Das Island.

On March 30 1963, a British agency was opened in Abu Dhabi and issued the agency stamps after the sheik objected to the use of the Trucial States definitives.  Mail from Das Island continued to be administered by Bahrain but was now cancelled by an Abu Dhabi Trucial States postmark.

The first Abu Dhabi stamps were a definitive series of March 30 1964 depicting Shaikh Shakhbut Bin-Sultan Al Nahyan.  There were eleven values under the Indian currency that was used of 100 naye paise = 1 rupee.  The range of values was 5 np to 10 rupees.  Despite the introduction of these definitives, the British agency stamps remained valid in both Abu Dhabi and Das Island until the end of 1966 when they were withdrawn.

A post office was opened on Das Island on 6 January 1966 and this ended the Bahrain service.  Mail from Das Island was now handled within Abu Dhabi.

When the treaty with Great Britain expired at the end of 1966, Abu Dhabi introduced a new currency of 1000 fils = 1 dinar and took over its own postal administration, including the Das Island office. The earlier issues were subject to surcharges in this currency and replacement definitives were released depicting the new ruler Shaikh Zaid.  Issues continued until introduction of UAE stamps in 1973.

In all, Abu Dhabi issued 95 stamps from 1964 to 1972, the final set being three views of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

Admirable restraint was shown, in comparison with others of the Trucial States, and the majority of stamps are relevant to Abu Dhabi, which makes it well worth collecting.

<h1> Climate </h1>

Sunny/blue skies can be expected through-out the year. The months June through September are generally hot and humid with temperatures averaging above 40ºC(110ºF). The weather is usually pleasant from October to May. January to February is cooler and may require the use of a light jacket. The oasis city of Al Ain enjoys cooler temperatures even through summer due to sporadic rainfall.

<h1> Transport </h1>

Abu Dhabi International Airport serves this city. The local time is GMT + 4 hours.

<h1> Trivia </h1>

The cartoon cat Garfield would often put his nemesis, the kitten Nermal, in a box and ship him to Abu Dhabi. A common phrase from Garfield: &quot;Abu Dhabi is where all the cute kittens go&quot;. Ironically, there is an active non-profit society named Feline Friends in Abu Dhabi and the other towns in the UAE which specialises in finding homes for abandoned or stray cats and kittens.

The letter A is the first (1st) letter in the Latin alphabet. Its name in English is a, plural a&apos;s or aes.

|}
<h1>History</h1>

The letter A probably started as a pictogram of an ox head in Egyptian hieroglyphs or the Proto-semitic alphabet.

By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet&apos;s letter had a linear form that served as the basis for all later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the Hebrew aleph.

When the Ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the glottal stop that the letter had denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, so they used the sign for the vowel  / / , and changed its name to alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to what was Italy and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write Latin, and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern Latin alphabet used to write many languages, including English.

<h1>Typography</h1>

The modern lowercase letter  a  derives from Greek handwriting, which evolved from a form similar to the current capital to a circular shape with a projection by the 4th century.

<h1>Usage</h1>

In English, the letter A by itself usually denotes the lax open front unrounded vowel (IPA / /) as in pad, the open back unrounded vowel (IPA  / / ) as in father, or, in concert with a later e, the diphthong  /e /  (though the actual pronunciation depends on the dialect) as in ace, due to effects of the Great vowel shift.

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, the letter A denotes either an open back unrounded vowel (IPA  / / ), or an open central unrounded vowel (IPA /a/).

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, variants of the letter A denote various vowels. In X-SAMPA, capital A denotes the open back unrounded vowel and lowercase a denotes the open front unrounded vowel.

A also is the English indefinite article, extended to an before a vowel.

<h1>Alternative representations</h1>

In the NATO phonetic alphabet the letter A is Alfa (which may also be spelled Alpha in English-only environments).

In international Morse code the letter A is DitDah:  · -

In Braille the letter A is represented as     (in Unicode), the dot pattern:
75px

<h2>Computing</h2>
In Unicode the capital A is codepoint U+0041 and the lowercase a is U+0061.

In Hex, A is the character used to represent decimal 10, or in binary, 01010

The ASCII code for capital A is 65 and for lowercase a is 97; or in binary 01000001 and 01100001, correspondingly.

The EBCDIC code for capital A is 193 and for lowercase a is 129.

The numeric character references in HTML and XML are &quot;  #65; &quot; and &quot;  #97; &quot; for upper and lower case respectively.

<h1>Meanings for A</h1>

Alabama is a state located in the southern United States.

<h1> History </h1>
Main article: History of Alabama

The memory of the Native American presence is particularly strong in Alabama. Among Native American people once living in present Alabama were Alabama (Alibamu), Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Koasati, and Mobile.  Trade with the Northeast via the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period  (1000 B.C.-A.D. 700) and continued until European contact.  Meso-American influence is evident in the agrarian Mississippian culture that followed.

The French established the first European settlement in the state with the establishment of Mobile in 1702.  Southern Alabama was French from 1702 1763, part of British West Florida from 1763 1780, and part of Spanish West Florida from 1780 1814. Northern and central Alabama was part of British Georgia from 1763 1783 and part of the American Mississippi territory thereafter. Its statehood delayed by the lack of a coastline (rectified when Andrew Jackson captured Spanish Mobile in 1814), Alabama became the 22nd state in 1819.

The state of Alabama seceded from the Union on January 11, 1861 and became the Alabama Republic and on February 18 1861 became a Confederate state.  While not many battles were fought in the state, it contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the Civil War.  After the war a provisional government was set up in 1865 and Alabama was officially readmitted to the Union on July 14 1868.

The cradle of the Confederacy during the Civil War, Alabama was at stage center in the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

<h1> Law and government </h1>
Main article: Law and Government of Alabama
<h2> Local &amp; County Government </h2>
Alabama has 67 counties, each having its own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.  Due to the restraints placed in the Alabama Constitution, all but 7 counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no home rule.  Instead, most counties in the state have to lobby to the Local Legislation Committee the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.

<h2> Political Climate </h2>

The current governor of the state is Bob Riley and the two U.S. senators are Jefferson B. Sessions III and Richard C. Shelby (all three from the Republican Party).  The current Alabama Constitution was adopted in 1901.

During Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1877, the Reconstruction period ended with the recognition of Rutherford B. Hayes as President-elect. White Southerners assumed control of the government and passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise black residents.  The state became part of the &quot;Solid South,&quot; a one-party system in which the Democratic Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state.  For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally no Republican challenger running.

From 1876 through 1956, Alabama supported only Democratic presidential candidates, by margins as high as 73 percentage points.  In 1960, Alabama gave most of its electoral votes to segregationist candidate Harry F. Byrd.  In 1964, the national Republican Party began to win more votes in the South by following a &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; which emphasized &quot;states&apos; rights&quot; and the increasing liberalism of the national Democratic Party.  The first such candidate was conservative Barry Goldwater, who became the first Republican candidate supported by Alabama.  In 1968, Alabama supported native son and American Independent Party (Segregationist) candidate George Wallace.

The last Democratic candidate to win Alabama&apos;s votes in a presidential election was Southerner Jimmy Carter in 1976.  Today, the Republican party has become increasingly dominant in conservative Alabama politics. However, in local politics, Democrats still control many offices, including majorities in both houses of the Legislature, and registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state.  In 2004, George W. Bush won Alabama&apos;s nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5% of the vote.  The only 11 counties voting Democratic were Black Belt counties, where African Americans are in the majority.

:For other uses, see Achilles (disambiguation).

In Greek mythology,   χιλλεύς , transliterated to Akhilleus or Achilleus in Roman letters, Latinized from this ancient Greek to Achilles, appearing in Etruscan as Achle, was a hero (ancient Greek heros, &quot;defender&quot;) of the Trojan War, the greatest and the most central character of Homer&apos;s Iliad.

<h1>The Name</h1>

The very first two lines of that magnificent and defining poem of ancient Greek culture (indeed, probably of the preceding Indo-European culture), read (in transliteration):

:&quot;Menin aeide thea, Peleiadeo Akhileos
:oulomenen, he muri&apos; Akhaiois alge&apos; etheken,&quot;

:Sing, Muse, the wrath of Achilles the son of Peleus,
:the destructive wrath, that brought a thousand griefs upon the Achaeans,&quot;

In these lines we see the name Akhilleus Peleides, which is a praenomen and a patronymic, the latter being formed from Peleus with the suffix -ides: Achilles the son of Peleus. The system is similar to the names used by Scandinavians before modern times, such as Leif Erikson. It is no doubt much older than either culture.

Similarly, Peleus&apos; name would be Peleus Aiakides, Peleus the son of Aiakos. There is no nomen gentile, as among the Romans, indicating that clan names might not be Indo-European after all.

There is a very strong derivation of Achilles devised by Leonard Palmer and expostulated in the first work cited below, by Gregory Nagy. The name is Indo-European: &quot;whose laos has akhos&quot;, where laos is a corps of soldiers and akhos is grief.

As it is used in the poem, which is stuffed full of irony, there is a double entendre: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

<h1>Birth</h1>
Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus, king of the Myrmidons in Phthia (southeast Thessaly), and the sea nymph Thetis. Zeus and Poseidon were rivals for the hand of Thetis. That is until Prometheus the fire bringer revealed that if one of these gods wed Thetis, she would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit. When Achilles was born, Thetis had tried to make Achilles immortal by dipping him in the river Styx, but forgot to wet the heel she held him by, leaving him vulnerable. (See Achilles&apos; tendon.)

Homer, however, deliberately makes no mention of this; Achilles cannot be a hero if he is not at risk. Homer, however, does mention his being wounded, although not seriously, in the Iliad. In an earlier and less popular version of the story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. Peleus gave him (together with his young friend Patroclus) to Chiron the Centaur, on Mt. Pelion, to raise.

<h1>Achilles in the Trojan War</h1>

<h2>Telephus</h2>
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus. In the battle, Achilles wounded Telephus. The wound would not heal and Telephus asked an oracle who stated that &quot;he that wounded shall heal&quot;.

According to others&apos; reports about Euripides&apos; lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis, pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to help heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles&apos; aid in healing the wound. Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound and the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound, and Telephus healed. This is an example of sympathetic magic.

<h2>During the Trojan War</h2>
“The Rage of Achilles” by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo

Achilles is one of the only two people described as &quot;god-like&quot; in the Iliad. He shows a complete and total devotion to the excellence of his craft and, like a god, has almost no regard for life. Not his own   clearly he does not mind a swift death, so long as it is glorious (kleos)   and not really of others. His anger is absolute. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is the main theme of the Iliad.

Achilles&apos; charioteer&apos;s name was Automedon.

<h3>Troilus</h3>
According to Dares Phrygius&apos; Account of the Destruction of Troy, while this youngest son of Priam and Hecuba (some say that it was Apollo who fathered Troilus on Hecuba) was watering his horses at the Lion Fountain outside the walls of Troy, Achilles saw him and fell in love with his beauty (whose &quot;loveliness of form&quot; was described by Ibycus as being like &quot;gold thrice refined&quot;). The youth rejected his advances and took refuge inside the temple of Apollo. Achilles pursued him into the sanctuary and decapitated him on the god&apos;s own altar. (Tzetzes, scholiast on Lycophron). At the time Troilus was said to be a year short of his twentieth birthday, and the legend goes that if Troilus had reached his twentieth year, Troy would have been invincible. (First Vatican Mythographer)

<h3>Agamemnon and the death of Patroclus</h3>
The vast majority of ancient Greek artifacts indicate they were regarded as homosexual lovers, usually in the context of the religious institution of homosexuality as seen in other mythological tales. &apos;&apos;See discussion at Homosexuality in the Iliad

Achilles took twenty-three towns outside Troy, including Lyrnessos, where he captured Briseis to keep as a concubine. Meanwhile, Agamemnon took a woman named Chryseis and taunted her father, Chryses, a priest of Apollo, when he attempted to buy her back. Apollo sent a plague through the Greek armies and Agamemnon was forced to give Chryseis back to her father; however he took Briseis away from Achilles as compensation for his loss. This action sparked the central plot of the Iliad: Achilles becomes enraged and refuses to fight for the Greeks any further. The war goes badly, through the influence of Zeus, and the Greeks offer handsome reparations to their greatest warrior.  Achilles is visited by Odysseus, Ajax, and Phoenix who attempt to persuade him to return to battle, but Achilles still refuses to fight. Once the Greeks are pushed back to the ships, which are just starting to be set on fire by Hector, he agrees to allow Patroclus to fight in his place, wearing his armor. The next day Patroclus is killed and stripped of the armor by the Trojan hero Hector, who mistakes him for Achilles. Achilles is overwhelmed with grief for his lover, and the rage he once harbored toward Agamemnon begins shifting to Hector. Thetis, his mother, rises from the sea floor and berates him for excessive grief, reminding him it is a fine thing to sleep with women too. She obtains magnificent new armor for him from Hephaestus, and he returns to the fighting, killing Hector. He desecrates the body, dragging it behind his chariot before the walls of Troy three times, and refuses to allow it to receive funeral rites. When Priam, the king of Troy and Hector&apos;s father, comes secretly into the Greek camp to plead for the body, Achilles finally relents; in one of the most moving scenes of the Iliad, he receives Priam graciously and allows him to take the body away.

The greatness of Achilles lies in not just being the greatest Greek fighter ever, but in knowing the choice provided to him by Destiny. His mother Thetis had prophesied to him that if he pulled out of the Trojan War, he would enjoy a long and a happy life. If Achilles fought, however, he would die before the walls of Troy but assure an everlasting glory, surpassing that of all other heroes. He had made the choice, and coming face to face with it showed his greatness.

<h3>Zanthus</h3>
During the Trojan War, Xanthos, one of Achilles&apos; horses, was rebuked by Achilles for allowing Patroclus to be killed. Xanthus responded by saying (Hera temporarily gave him voice to do so) that a god and a mortal had killed Patroclus and a god and a mortal would soon kill Achilles  too.

<h3>Memnon, Cycnus, Penthesilea, and the death of Achilles</h3>
Thetis rising from the sea to comfort Achilles (Book 18), by Thomas Banks, English, 1778 Victoria and Albert Museum
Shortly after the death of Hector, Achilles defeated Memnon of Ethiopia, Cycnus of Colonae and the Amazonian warrior Penthesilia (with whom Achilles also had an affair in some versions). As predicted by Hector with his dying breath, Achilles was thereafter killed by Paris   either by an arrow to the heel (which may have subsequently become fatally infected), or in an older version by a knife to the back while visiting Polyxena, a princess of Troy. Both versions conspicuously deny the killer any sort of valor, and Achilles remains undefeated on the battlefield. His bones are mingled with those of Patroclus, and funeral games are held. Like Ajax, he is represented (although not by Homer) as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube.

<h3>The Fate of Achilles&apos; armor</h3>
Achilles&apos; armor was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Ajax the Greater (Achilles&apos; older cousin). They competed for it and Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and vowed to kill his comrades; he started killing cattle (thinking they were Greek soldiers), and then himself.

<h1> Other Stories About Achilles </h1>

After the Trojan War, Achilles sold Lycaon, son of Priam and Laothoe. Lycaon was later killed trying to escape.

In the Odyssey, also by Homer, there is a passage where Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who greeted as &quot;blessed in life, blessed in death&quot;, responds that he would rather be a slave than be dead. This has been interpreted as a rejection of his warrior life, but also as indignity to his martyrdom being slighted.

The kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son. Alexander the Great, son of the Epiran princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor; he is said to have visited his tomb while passing Troy. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the Greek colonies on the Black Sea.

Achilles fought and killed the Amazon Helene.

Some also said he married Medea.

<h1>The Lost Play of Aeschylus</h1>
In the early 1990s a lost play by Aeschylus was discovered in the wrappings of a mummy in Egypt. The play, Achilles, was part of a trilogy about the Trojan War. It was known to exist due to mentions in ancient sources, but had been lost for over 2,000 years.

There is another lost play with Achilles as the main character, The Lovers of Achilles, by Sophocles.

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809   April 15, 1865), sometimes called Abe Lincoln and nicknamed Honest Abe, the Rail Splitter, and the Great Emancipator, was the 16th President of the United States (1861 to 1865), and the first president from the Republican Party.

Lincoln staunchly opposed the expansion of slavery into federal territories, and his victory in the 1860 presidential election further polarized the nation. Before his inauguration in March of 1861, seven Southern slave states seceded  1   from the United States, formed the Confederate States of America, and took control of U.S. forts and other properties within their boundaries. These events soon led to the American Civil War.

Lincoln is often praised for his work as a wartime leader who proved adept at balancing competing considerations and at getting rival groups to work together toward a common goal. Lincoln had to negotiate between Radical and Moderate Republican leaders, who were often far apart on the issues, while attempting to win support from War Democrats and loyalists in the seceding states. He personally directed the war effort, which ultimately led the Union forces to victory over the Confederacy.

His leadership qualities were evident in his diplomatic handling of the border slave states at the beginning of the fighting, in his defeat of a congressional attempt to reorganize his cabinet in 1862, in his many speeches and writings which helped mobilize and inspire the North, and in his defusing of the peace issue in the 1864 presidential campaign. He is sometimes criticized for issuing executive orders suspending habeas corpus, imprisoning opposing government officials, and ordering the arrest of a number of publishers.

Some historians also argue that Lincoln had a lasting influence on U.S. political and social institutions. The most important may have been setting the precedent for greater centralization of powers in the federal government and a weakening of the powers of the individual state governments. 
This claim, however, is disputed as the federal government largely reverted to its former weakness after Reconstruction and the modern administrative state would only emerge with the New Deal some seventy years later.

Lincoln is most famous for his role in ending slavery in the United States with the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation as a pragmatic war measure which would set the stage for the complete abolition of the institution.

Lincoln was also the president who declared Thanksgiving as a national holiday, established the U.S. Department of Agriculture (though not as a Cabinet-level department), revived national banking and banks, and admitted West Virginia and Nevada as states. He also encouraged efforts to expand white settlement in western North America, signing the Homestead Act (1862).

Lincoln is usually ranked as one of the greatest presidents. He is criticized by some for overstepping the traditional bounds of executive power. Others fault him for his refusal to make efforts at compromise with the seceding states.
Because of his role in ending slavery, and his guiding the Union to victory in the civil war, his assassination made him a martyr to millions of Americans.

<h1>Early life</h1>
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a one-room log cabin on 348 acre (1.4 km ) Sinking Spring Farm in the Southeast part of Hardin County, Kentucky, then considered the frontier (now part of LaRue Co., in Nolin Creek, three miles (5 km) south of  Hodgenville), to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks. Lincoln was named after his deceased grandfather, Abraham Lincoln, who was killed in 1786 in a conflict with local Indians.  He was given just his grandfather&apos;s first and last name and was not given any middle name. Lincoln&apos;s parents were largely uneducated. Later, when Lincoln became more renowned, reporters and storytellers often exaggerated the poverty and obscurity of Lincoln&apos;s birth. In fact, Lincoln&apos;s father Thomas was a respected and relatively affluent citizen of the Kentucky backcountry. He had purchased the Sinking Spring Farm in December 1808 for $200 cash and assumption of a debt.  His parents belonged to a Baptist church that had pulled away from a larger church because they refused to support slavery.  Accordingly, from a very young age, Lincoln was exposed to anti-slavery sentiment.

Three years after purchasing the property, a prior land claim filed in Hardin Circuit Court forced the Lincolns to move. Thomas continued legal action until he lost the case in 1815.  Money spent on the lawsuit contributed to family difficulties.  In 1811, they were able to lease 30 acres (0.1 km ) of a 230 acre (0.9 km ) farm on Knob Creek a few miles away, where they then moved.  In a valley of the Rolling Fork River, this was some of the best farmland in the area. At this time, Lincoln&apos;s father was a respected community member and a successful farmer and carpenter. Lincoln&apos;s earliest recollections are from this farm.  In 1815, another claimant sought to eject the family from the Knob Creek farm.  Frustrated with litigation and lack of security provided by Kentucky courts, Thomas decided to move to Indiana, which had been surveyed by the federal government, making land titles more secure.  Historians believe that these problems motivated Abraham to later learn surveying and become an attorney.

In 1816, when Lincoln was seven years old, he and his parents moved to Spencer County, Indiana, he would state &quot;partly on account of slavery&quot; and partly because of economic difficulties in Kentucky (mostly derived from losing two homes and financing years of litigation). In 1830, after more economic and land-title difficulties in Indiana, the family settled on government land along the Sangamon River on a site selected by Lincoln&apos;s father in Macon County, Illinois, near the present city of Decatur. The following winter was especially brutal, and the family nearly moved back to Indiana. When his father relocated the family to a nearby site the following year, the 22-year-old Lincoln struck out on his own, canoeing down the Sangamon to homestead on his own in Sangamon County, Illinois (now in Menard County), in the village of New Salem. Later that year, hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon, Illinois and Mississippi rivers. While in New Orleans, he may have witnessed a slave auction that left an indelible impression on him for the rest of his life. Whether he actually witnessed a slave auction at that time or not, living in a country with a considerable slave presence, he probably saw similar atrocities from time to time.

Young Abraham Lincoln

<h1> Early career </h1>

Lincoln began his political career in 1832 at the age of 23 with a campaign for the Illinois General Assembly as a member of the  Whig Party. The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River in the hopes of attracting steamboat traffic to the river, which would allow sparsely populated, poor areas along and near the river to grow and prosper. He served as a captain in a company of the Illinois militia drawn from New Salem during the Black Hawk War, although he never saw combat.  He wrote after being elected by his peers that he had not had &quot;any such success in life which gave him so much satisfaction.&quot;

He later tried his hand at several business and political ventures, and failed at them all. He held an Illinois state liquor license and operated several taverns.  Finally, after coming across the second volume of Sir William Blackstone&apos;s four-volume Commentaries on the Laws of England, he taught himself the law, and was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1837. That same year, he moved to Springfield, Illinois and began to practice law with Stephen T. Logan. He became one of the most highly respected and successful lawyers in the state of Illinois, and became steadily more prosperous. Lincoln served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives, as a representative from Sangamon County, beginning in 1834. In 1837 he made his first protest against slavery in the Illinois House, stating that the institution was &quot;founded on both injustice and bad policy.&quot;

Lincoln shared a bed with Joshua Fry Speed from 1837 to 1841 in Springfield. While many claim it was not uncommon in the mid-19th century for men to share a bed (just as two men today may share a house or an apartment), C.A. Tripp&apos;s 2005 biography, The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln, suggesting that their relationship may also have been sexual, has generated a great deal of controversy.

In 1841, Lincoln entered law practice with William Herndon, a fellow member of the Whig Party. In 1856, both men joined the fledgling Republican Party. Following Lincoln&apos;s assassination, Herndon began collecting stories about Lincoln from those who knew him in central Illinois, eventually publishing a book, Herndon&apos;s Lincoln.

<h1>Marriage</h1>
On November 4, 1842, at the age of 33, Lincoln married Mary Todd. The couple had four sons.
*Robert Todd Lincoln: b. August 1, 1843, in Springfield, Illinois; d. July 26, 1926, in Manchester, Vermont.
*Edward Baker Lincoln: b. March 10, 1846, in Springfield, Illinois; d. February 1, 1850, in Springfield, Illinois. (Named after a close friend of Lincoln&apos;s, Congressman Edward D. Baker.)
*William Wallace Lincoln: b. December 21, 1850, in Springfield, Illinois; d. February 20, 1862, in Washington, D.C.
*Thomas &quot;Tad&quot; Lincoln: b. April 4, 1853, in Springfield, Illinois; d. July 16, 1871, in Chicago, Illinois.

Only Robert survived into adulthood. Of Robert&apos;s three children, only Jessie Lincoln had any children (two: Mary Lincoln Beckwith and Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith). Neither Robert Beckwith nor Mary Beckwith had any children, so Abraham Lincoln&apos;s bloodline ended when Robert Beckwith (Lincoln&apos;s great-grandson) died on December 24, 1985.

<h1>Towards the presidency</h1>
Lincoln in 1846 or 1847
In 1846 Lincoln was elected to one term in the House of Representatives as a member of the United States Whig Party. A staunch Whig, Lincoln often referred to Whig leader Henry Clay as his political idol. As a freshman House member, Lincoln was not a particularly powerful or influential figure in Congress. He used his office as an opportunity to speak out against the war with Mexico, which he attributed to President Polk&apos;s desire for &quot;military glory   that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood.&quot;

Lincoln was a key early supporter of Zachary Taylor&apos;s candidacy for the 1848 Whig Presidential nomination. When his term ended, the incoming Taylor administration offered him the governorship of the Oregon Territory. He declined, returning instead to Springfield, Illinois where, although remaining active in Whig Party affairs in the state, he turned most of his energies to making a living at the bar.

By the mid-1850s, Lincoln had acquired prominence in Illinois legal circles, especially through his involvement in litigation involving competing transportation interests   both the river barges and the railroads. In 1849, he received a patent related to buoying vessels.

Lincoln represented the Alton &amp; Sangamon Railroad, for example, in an 1851 dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret. Barret had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to that corporation on the ground that it had changed its originally planned route. Lincoln argued that as a matter of law a corporation is not bound by its original charter when that charter can be amended in the public interest, that the newer proposed Alton &amp; Sangamon route was superior and less expensive, and that accordingly the corporation had a right to sue Mr. Barret for his delinquent payment. He won this case, and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by several other courts throughout the United States.

Another important example of Lincoln&apos;s skills as a railroad lawyer was a lawsuit over a tax exemption that the state granted to the Illinois Central Railroad. McLean County argued that the state had no authority to grant such an exemption, and it sought to impose taxes on the railroad notwithstanding. In January 1856, the Illinois Supreme Court delivered its opinion upholding the tax exemption, accepting Lincoln&apos;s arguments.

In addition, Lincoln worked on at least one criminal trial in 1858 when he defended William &quot;Duff&quot; Armstrong pro bono, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for when Lincoln used judicial notice, a rare tactic at that time, to show an eyewitness had lied on the stand, claiming he witnessed the crime in the moonlight. Lincoln produced a Farmer&apos;s Almanac to show that the moon on that date was at such a low angle it could not have produced enough illumination for the would-be witness to see anything clearly. Based upon this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which expressly repealed the limits on slavery&apos;s spread that had been part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820, helped draw Lincoln back into electoral politics. It was a speech against Kansas-Nebraska, on October 16, 1854 in Peoria, that caused Lincoln to stand out among the other free-soil orators of the day.

Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, proposing popular sovereignty as the solution to the slavery impasse, had sponsored the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Many eastern Republicans had urged the nomination of Douglas for the United States Senate in 1858, since he was a Northern leader who had led the opposition to the Buchanan administration&apos;s push for the Lecompton Constitution which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state.

Accepting the Republican nomination for the Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered a famous speech  in which he stated, &quot;A house divided against itself cannot stand.&quot; (This statement is spoken by Jesus in Matthew 12:25.) The speech created a lasting image of the danger of disunion due to slavery. Lincoln was viewed as a heavy underdog against the popular Douglas.

During his unsuccessful 1858 campaign for the Senate, Lincoln debated Douglas in a series of events which became a national discussion on the issues that were about to split the nation in two. During the debates, Lincoln forced Douglas to propose his Freeport Doctrine, which lost him further support among slave-holders and may have forced the eventual dissolution of the Democratic Party. Though Douglas was eventually reelected by the Illinois legislature (this was before the 17th Amendment), Lincoln&apos;s eloquence during the campaign transformed him into a national political star.

<h1>Election and early Presidency</h1>
&quot;The Rail Candidate&quot;, political cartoon, 1860
Lincoln was chosen as the Republican candidate for several reasons: because his views on slavery were seen as more moderate; because of his Western origins (in contrast to his main rival for the nomination, the New Yorker William H. Seward), and because several other contenders had enemies within the party. During the campaign, Lincoln was dubbed &quot;The Rail Splitter&quot; by Republicans to emphasize Lincoln&apos;s humility and humble origins, though in fact Lincoln was quite wealthy at the time due to his successful law practice.

On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Douglas and two other major candidates. Lincoln was the first Republican president. He won entirely on the strength of his support in the North: he was not even on the ballot in nine states in the South   and won only 2 of 996 counties in the entire South. Even before Lincoln&apos;s election, leaders in the South made it clear that their states would leave the Union in response to a Lincoln victory. A total of seven states seceded before Lincoln took office, forming the Confederate States of America.

President-elect Lincoln survived an assassination attempt in Baltimore, Maryland, and on February 23, 1861 arrived secretly in disguise to Washington, D.C. Southerners ridiculed Lincoln for this subterfuge, but the efforts at security may have been prudent. At Lincoln&apos;s inauguration on March 4, 1861, the Turners formed Lincoln&apos;s bodyguard; and a sizable garrison of federal troops was also present, ready to protect the president and the capital from rebel invasion.

Photograph showing March 4, 1861 inauguration of Abraham Lincoln in front of U.S. Capitol
In his First Inaugural Address, Lincoln declared, &quot;I hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution the Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not expressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments&quot;, arguing further that the purpose of the United States Constitution was &quot;to form a more perfect union&quot; than the Articles of Confederation which were explicitly perpetual, and thus the Constitution too was perpetual. He asked rhetorically that even were the Constitution construed as a simple contract, would it not require the agreement of all parties to rescind it?

Also in his inaugural address, in a final attempt to unite the Union and prevent the looming war, Lincoln supported the proposed Corwin Amendment to the constitution, of which he was a driving force. This proposed amendment would have explicitly protected slavery in those states in which it already existed, and had already passed both houses. Lincoln, however, adamantly opposed the Crittenden Compromise, which would have permitted slavery in the territories, renewing the boundary set by the Missouri Compromise and extending it to California. Despite support for this compromise among moderate Republicans and across the nation, Lincoln declared that were the Crittenden Compromise accepted, it &quot;would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people, tribe, and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego.&quot; Lincoln also spurned requests to appoint a Southerner to his cabinet (Sam Houston, at that time governor of Texas  and supporting the Union but rejecting offered troops to prevent secession, being a prominent suggestion).

Because opposition to slavery expansion was the key issue uniting the Republican Party at the time, Lincoln is sometimes criticized for putting politics ahead of the national interest in refusing to compromise on the slavery expansion issue. Supporters of Lincoln, however, point out that he did not oppose slavery because he was a Republican, but became a Republican because of his opposition to the expansion of slavery, that he opposed several other Republicans who were in favor of compromise, and that he clearly thought his course of action was in the national interest.

After Union troops at Fort Sumter were fired on and forced to surrender in April, Lincoln called for more troops from each remaining state to recapture forts, protect the capital, and &quot;preserve the Union&quot;, which in his view still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. In response, four more slave states seceded by May 1861, and splinter factions from Missouri and Kentucky joined the Confederacy by December.

<h2>Slavery and the Emancipation Proclamation</h2>
Lincoln met with his Cabinet for the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation draft on July 22, 1862.

Lincoln is well known for ending slavery in the United States and he personally opposed slavery as a moral evil. Yet, Lincoln&apos;s views of the role of the federal government on the subject of slavery are more complicated. He believed that the Declaration of Independence&apos;s statement that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; should apply also to black slaves, and that slavery was a profound evil which should not spread to the Territories. Thus, he campaigned against the Kansas-Nebraska Act. However, Lincoln maintained that the federal government could not constitutionally bar slavery in states where it already existed, and he supported colonization, believing that freed black slaves were too different to live in the same society as white Americans. Lincoln addresses the issue of his consistency (or lack thereof) between his earlier position and his later position of emancipation in an 1864 letter to Albert G. Hodges See: Abraham Lincoln on slavery.

Lincoln is often credited with freeing enslaved African Americans with the Emancipation Proclamation. However, territories and states that still allowed slavery but were under Union control were exempt from the emancipation. The proclamation initially freed only a few escaped slaves, but also enabled the freeing of slaves in territories captured after its proclamation. Lincoln signed the Proclamation as a wartime measure, insisting that only the outbreak of war gave constitutional power to the President to free slaves in states where it already existed. He later said: &quot;I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.&quot; The proclamation made abolishing slavery in the rebel states an official war goal and it became the impetus for the enactment of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution which abolished slavery. Politically, the Emancipation Proclamation did much to help the Northern cause; Lincoln&apos;s strong abolitionist stand finally convinced the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and other foreign countries that they could not support the South.

<h1>Important non-Civil War measures of Lincoln&apos;s first term</h1>
While Lincoln is usually portrayed bearded, he only grew a beard the last few years of his life, at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell.

Perhaps Lincoln&apos;s most important contribution as President, outside of his military leadership as Commander-in-Chief, was his signing of the Homestead Act in 1862, though Lincoln had little do with the drafting of the act or its passage in Congress. Considered by some to be the most important piece of legislation in American history, the Act made available millions of acres of government-held land in the Midwest for purchase at very low cost. Any male over the age of 21 could obtain a Homestead tract of 160 acres (647,000 m ) simply by filing a claim and paying a processing fee of $18. The land had then to be lived upon, built up, and improved, for a period of no less than five years. Many were more than willing to take up this challenge.

The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed by Lincoln in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural universities throughout the American states. Such universities often founded in Homesteading states -- provided education and know-how for masses of local Homesteaders. They helped found the concept of scientific agriculture and, perhaps more importantly, helped democratize American education. Like the Homestead Act, Lincoln had little to do with this act&apos;s framing or passage in Congress.

After the &quot;Sioux Uprising&quot; of August 1862 in Minnesota, Lincoln was presented with 303 death warrants for convicted Santee Dakota who had taken part. Lincoln affirmed 39 of these for execution (one was later reprieved). Lincoln was strongly chastised for this action in Minnesota and throughout his administration because many felt that all 303 Native Americans should have been executed. Reaction in Minnesota was so strong concerning Lincoln&apos;s leniency toward the Native Americans that Republicans lost their political strength in the state in 1864. Lincoln&apos;s response was, &quot;I could not afford to hang men for votes.&quot;

<h1>1864 election and Second Inauguration</h1>

After Lincoln&apos;s election, on March 4, 1865, he delivered his second inaugural address, which was his favorite of all his speeches. At this time, a victory over the secessionists was within sight, slavery had effectively ended, and Lincoln was looking to the future.

<h1>Civil War and Reconstruction</h1>
<h2>Conducting the war effort</h2>
The war was a source of constant frustration for the president, and it occupied nearly all of his time. Lincoln had a contentious relationship with General George B. McClellan, who became general-in-chief of all the Union armies in the wake of the embarrassing Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run and after the retirement of Winfield Scott in late 1861. Lincoln wished to take an active part in planning the war strategy despite his inexperience in military affairs. Lincoln&apos;s strategic priorities were two-fold: first, to ensure that Washington, D.C., was well-defended; and second, to conduct an aggressive war effort in hopes of ending the war quickly and appeasing the Northern public and press, who pushed for an offensive war. McClellan, a youthful West Point graduate and railroad executive called back to military service, took a more cautious approach. McClellan took several months to plan and execute his Peninsula Campaign, which involved capturing Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula between the James and York Rivers. McClellan&apos;s delay irritated Lincoln, as did McClellan&apos;s insistence that no troops were needed to defend Washington, D.C. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan&apos;s troops to defend the capital, a decision McClellan blamed for the ultimate failure of his Peninsula Campaign.

McClellan, a lifelong Democrat who was temperamentally conservative, was relieved as general-in-chief after releasing his Harrison&apos;s Landing Letter, where he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan&apos;s letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint fellow Republican John Pope as head of the new Army of Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln&apos;s strategic desire for the Union to move towards Richmond from the north, thus guarding Washington, D.C. However, Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run during the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac back into the defenses of Washington for a second time, leading to Pope&apos;s being sent west to fight against the American Indians.

Panicked by Confederate General Robert E. Lee&apos;s invasion of Maryland, Lincoln restored McClellan to command of all forces around Washington in time for the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. It was the Union victory in that battle that allowed Lincoln to release his Emancipation Proclamation. Lincoln relieved McClellan of command shortly after the 1862 midterm elections and appointed Republican Ambrose Burnside to head the Army of the Potomac, who promised to follow through on Lincoln&apos;s strategic vision for an aggressive offensive against Lee and Richmond. After Burnside was embarrassingly routed at Fredericksburg, Joseph Hooker assumed command, but was routed at Chancellorsville in May 1863 and also relieved of command.

After the Union victory at Gettysburg and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac, Lincoln made the fateful decision to appoint a new army commander: General Ulysses S. Grant, who was disfavored by Republican hardliners because he had been a Democrat, but who had a solid string of victories in the Western Theater, including Vicksburg and Chattanooga. Earlier, reacting to criticism of Grant, Lincoln was quoted as saying, &quot;I cannot spare this man. He fights.&quot; Grant waged his bloody Overland Campaign in 1864, using a strategy of a war of attrition, characterized by high Union losses at battles such as the Wilderness and Cold Harbor, but by proportionately higher losses in the Confederate army. Grant&apos;s aggressive campaign would eventually bottle up Lee in the Siege of Petersburg and result in the Union taking Richmond and bringing the war to a close in the spring of 1865.

Lincoln authorized Grant to use a scorched earth approach to destroy the South&apos;s morale and economic ability to continue the war. This allowed Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Philip Sheridan to destroy factories, farms, and cities in the Shenandoah Valley, Georgia, and South Carolina. The damage in Sherman&apos;s March to the Sea through Georgia totaled in excess of $100 million.

Lincoln had a star-crossed record as a military leader, possessing a keen understanding of strategic points (such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg) and the importance of defeating the enemy&apos;s army, rather than simply capturing cities. However, he had little success in his efforts to motivate his generals to adopt his strategies. Eventually, he found in Grant a man who shared his vision of the war and was able to bring that vision to reality with his relentless pursuit of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters of war.

Lincoln, perhaps reflecting his lack of military experience, developed a keen curiosity with military campaigning during the war. He spent hours at the War Department telegraph office, reading dispatches from his generals through many a night. He frequently visited battle sites and seemed fascinated by watching scenes of war. During Jubal A. Early&apos;s raid into Washington, D.C., in 1864, Lincoln had to be told to duck his head to avoid being shot observing the scenes of battle.

<h2>Homefront</h2>
Lincoln was more successful in giving the war meaning to Northern civilians through his oratorical skills. Despite his meager education and  backwoods  upbringing, Lincoln possessed an extraordinary command of the English language, as evidenced by the Gettysburg Address, a speech dedicating a cemetery of Union soldiers from the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. While the featured speaker, orator Edward Everett, spoke for two hours, Lincoln&apos;s few choice words resonated across the nation and across history, defying Lincoln&apos;s own prediction that &quot;the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here.&quot; Lincoln&apos;s second inaugural address is also greatly admired and often quoted. In these speeches, Lincoln articulated better than any of his contemporaries the rationale behind the Union effort.

During the Civil War, Lincoln exercised powers no previous president had wielded; he proclaimed a blockade, suspended the writ of habeas corpus, spent money without congressional authorization, and frequently imprisoned accused Southern spies and sympathizers without trial. Some scholars have argued that Lincoln&apos;s political arrests extended to the highest levels of the government, including an attempted warrant for Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, though the allegation remains unresolved and controversial (see the Taney Arrest Warrant controversy).

Lincoln was the only U.S. President to face a presidential election during a civil war (in 1864). The long war and the issue of emancipation appeared to be severely hampering his prospects and an electoral defeat appeared likely against the Democratic nominee and former general, George McClellan. Lincoln ran under the Union party banner, composed of War Democrats and Republicans. General Grant was facing severe criticism for his conduct of the bloody Overland Campaign that summer and the seemingly endless Siege of Petersburg. However, the Union capture of the key railroad center of Atlanta by Sherman&apos;s forces in September changed the situation dramatically and Lincoln was reelected.

<h2>Reconstruction</h2>
The reconstruction of the Union weighed heavy on the President&apos;s mind throughout the war effort. He was determined to take a course that would not permanently alienate the former Confederate states, and throughout the war Lincoln urged speedy elections under generous terms in areas behind Union lines. This irritated congressional Republicans, who urged a more stringent Reconstruction policy. One of Lincoln&apos;s few vetoes during his term was of the Wade-Davis Bill, an effort by congressional Republicans to impose harsher Reconstruction terms on the Confederate areas. Republicans in Congress retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee during the war under Lincoln&apos;s generous terms.

&quot;Let &apos;em up easy,&quot; he told his assembled military leaders Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (a future president), Gen. William T. Sherman and Adm. David Dixon Porter in an 1865 meeting on the steamer River Queen. When Richmond, the Confederate capital, was at long last captured, Lincoln went there to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis&apos;s own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. He was greeted at the city as a conquering hero by freed slaves, whose sentiments were epitomized by one admirer&apos;s quote, &quot;I know I am free for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.&quot;

On April 9, 1865, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. This left only Joseph Johnston&apos;s forces in the East to deal with. Weeks later Johnston would defy Jefferson Davis and surrender his forces to Sherman. Of course, Lincoln would not survive to see the surrender of all Confederate forces; just five days after Lee surrendered, Lincoln was assassinated.

<h1>Assassination</h1>
The assassination of Abraham Lincoln. From left to right: Henry Rathbone, Clara Harris, Mary Todd Lincoln, Lincoln, and Booth.

Lincoln had met frequently with Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant as the war drew to a close. The two men planned matters of reconstruction, and it was evident to all that they held each other in high regard. During their last meeting, on April 14, 1865 (Good Friday), Lincoln invited Grant to a social engagement that evening. Grant declined (Grant&apos;s wife, Julia Dent Grant, is said to have strongly disliked Mary Todd Lincoln). The President&apos;s eldest son, Robert Todd Lincoln, also turned down the invitation.

Without his bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon, to whom he related his famous dream of his own assassination, the Lincolns left to attend a play at Ford&apos;s Theater. The play was Our American Cousin, a musical comedy by the British writer Tom Taylor. As Lincoln sat in his state box in the balcony, John Wilkes Booth, a well-known actor and Southern sympathizer from Maryland, crept up behind the President&apos;s box and waited for the funniest line of the play hoping the laughter would cover the gunshot noise. On stage, actor Harry Hawk said the last line Lincoln would ever hear &quot;Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal—you sockdologizing old man-trap...&quot;. When the laughter came John Wilkes Booth jumped into the box the president was in and aimed a single-shot, round-slug .44 caliber Deringer at his head, firing at point-blank range.  The bullet entered behind Lincoln&apos;s left ear and lodged behind his eyeball.  Booth then shouted &quot;Sic semper tyrannis!&quot; (Latin: &quot;Thus always to tyrants,&quot; and Virginia&apos;s state motto; some accounts say he added &quot;The South is avenged!&quot;) and jumped from the balcony to the stage below. But as he dropped, the spur of his boot became caught in the American flag draping the box, and he fell awkwardly onto the stage, breaking his leg.

Despite his injury, Booth managed to limp to his horse and escape, and the mortally wounded &amp; paralyzed President was taken to a house across the street, now called the Petersen House, where he lay in a coma for some time before he quietly expired. Abraham Lincoln was officially pronounced dead at 7:22 AM the next morning, April 15, 1865 (Easter Saturday). Upon seeing him die, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton lamented &quot;Now he belongs to the ages.&quot;

After Lincoln&apos;s body was returned to the White House officials prepared him for his &quot;lying in state,&quot; and now a newly discovered photograph from the estate of photographer, artist and engraver John B. Bachelder has surfaced showing Abraham Lincoln but a few hours post mortem. It was published for the first time ever in Lloyd Ostendorf&apos;s last book 
(&quot;Lincoln&apos;s Photographs: A Complete Album&quot; by Lloyd Ostendorf,
Rockywood Press, Dayton, Ohio, 2004). As an archivist of Lincoln photographs published before his untimely death in September of 2004, Mr. Ostendorf 
labeled the photo in question here &quot;O-130&quot;, and since there are currently 130 known photos of Lincoln, it is considered the most recent photographic discovery of Lincoln.  Mr. Ostendorf did not include the details in his book of how he came upon the picture, however it is surmised that John B. Bachelder&apos;s descendants found it and let Mr. Ostendorf know about it and use it.
The photograph of the 16th President is not linked here out of
lurid interest, nor morbid curiosity, but as a new historical find, if authentic it is in fact the only immediately post mortem photograph of
the late beloved president to be taken by Mr. Meserve, on the morning of
April 15th 1865. Link:(WARNING; possibly disturbing image)

Booth and several other conspirators had planned to kill a number of other government officials at the same time, but for various reasons Lincoln&apos;s was the only assassination actually carried out (although Secretary of State Seward was badly injured by an assailant). Several of the conspirators were eventually captured. Four people were tried by military tribunal and hanged for the assassination plot (David Herold, George Atzerodt, Lewis Powell (aka Lewis Payne) and Mary Surratt, the first woman ever executed by the United States government.) Three people were sentenced to life imprisonment (Michael O&apos;Laughlin, Samuel Arnold and Dr. Samuel Mudd). Edman Spangler  was sentenced to six years imprisonment. John Surratt, tried later by a civilian court, was acquitted. The fairness of the convictions, particularly of Mary Surratt, have been called into question, and there are doubts as to the exact degree of her involvement, if any. Booth himself was shot when discovered holed up in a barn (the barn itself collapsed in the 1930s and the site is now the median of a state highway in Virginia).

Lincoln&apos;s funeral train carried his remains, as well as 300 mourners and the casket of his son William, 1,654 miles to Illinois.
Lincoln&apos;s body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois. The nation mourned a man whom many viewed as the savior of the United States. He was buried in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, where a 177 foot (54 m) tall granite tomb surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln was constructed by 1874. To prevent continued attempts to steal Lincoln&apos;s body and hold it for ransom, Robert Todd Lincoln had Lincoln exhumed and reinterred in concrete several feet thick on September 26, 1901. See Abraham Lincoln&apos;s burial and exhumation.

Many medical experts now suspect that Lincoln may have suffered from congestive heart failure and Marfan syndrome, both of which can be fatal.

<h1>Legacy and memorials</h1>
Lincoln&apos;s death made the President a martyr to many. Today he is perhaps America&apos;s second most famous and beloved President after George Washington. Repeated polls of historians have ranked Lincoln as among the greatest presidents in U.S. history. Among contemporary admirers, Lincoln is usually seen as a figure who personifies classical values of honesty, integrity, as well as respect for individual and minority rights, and human freedom in general. Many American organizations of all purposes and agendas continue to cite his name and image, with interests ranging from the gay rights group Log Cabin Republicans to the insurance corporation Lincoln Financial.

Over the years Lincoln has been memorialized in many city names, notably the capital of Nebraska; with the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. (pictured, right); on the U.S. $5 bill and the 1 cent coin (Illinois is the primary opponent to the removal of the penny from circulation); and as part of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Lincoln&apos;s Tomb, Lincoln&apos;s Home in Springfield, New Salem, Illinois (a reconstruction of Lincoln&apos;s early adult hometown), Ford&apos;s Theater and Petersen House are all preserved as museums. The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln.

Counties in 17 U.S. states (Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, West Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) are named after Lincoln.

On February 12, 1892, Abraham Lincoln&apos;s birthday was declared to be a federal holiday in the United States, although in 1971 it was combined with Washington&apos;s birthday in the form of President&apos;s Day. February 12 is still observed as a separate legal holiday in many states, including Illinois.

Lincoln&apos;s birthplace and family home are national historic memorials: Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville, Kentucky and Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is also in Springfield.  The Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery is located in Elwood, Illinois.

Statues of Lincoln can be found in other countries. In Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, is a 13-foot high bronze statue, a gift from the United States, dedicated in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. The U.S. received a statue of Benito Juárez in exchange, which is in Washington, D.C. Juárez and Lincoln exchanged friendly letters, and Mexico remembers Lincoln&apos;s opposition to the Mexican-American War. There is also a statue in Tijuana, Mexico, showing Lincoln standing and destroying the chains of slavery. There are at least three statues of Lincoln in United Kingdom one in London, one in Manchester and another in Edinburgh.

The ballistic missile submarine Abraham Lincoln (SSBN-602) and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) were named in his honor.

Director Steven Spielberg is currently planning a movie on Lincoln with Liam Neeson in the leading role.

The American Disney theme parks feature an Audio-Animatronics Abraham Lincoln in the show Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln and the Hall of Presidents.

In a recent public vote entitled &quot;The Greatest American,&quot; Lincoln placed second.

<h1>Trivia</h1>
* Lincoln stood 6&apos;3 3/4&quot; (192 cm) tall and thus was the tallest president in U.S. history, just edging out Lyndon Johnson at 6&apos;3 1/2&quot; (192 cm).
* Lincoln and Charles Darwin were born on the same day of the same year, February 12, 1809.
* The last surviving self-described witness to Lincoln&apos;s assassination was Samuel J. Seymour (~1860 April 14, 1956), who appeared two months before his death at age 96 on the CBS-TV quiz show I&apos;ve Got a Secret. As a five-year-old, he said that he thought at first that he, himself, had been shot because his nurse, trying to fix a torn place in his blouse, stuck him with a pin at the moment of the gun&apos;s discharge.
* According to legend, Lincoln was referred to as &quot;two-faced&quot; by his opponent in the 1858 Senate election, Stephen Douglas. Upon hearing about this Lincoln jokingly replied, &quot;If I had another face to wear, do you really think I would be wearing this one?&quot;
* According to legend, Lincoln also said, as a young man, on his appearance one day when looking in the mirror: &quot;It&apos;s a fact, Abe! You are the ugliest man in the world. If ever I see a man uglier than you, I&apos;m going to shoot him on the spot!&quot; It would no doubt, he thought, be an act of mercy.

<h1>Quotes</h1>
* &quot;If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what&apos;s said against me won&apos;t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.&quot; The Inner Life of Abraham Lincoln: Six Months at the White House by Francis B. Carpenter (University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1995), pp. 258-259.
*&quot;Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it.&quot; The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln edited by Roy P. Basler, Volume III, &quot;Letter To Henry L. Pierce and Others&quot; (April 6, 1859), p. 376.

Aristotle, marble copy of bronze by Lysippos. Louvre Museum.

Aristotle (Greek:            
Aristotel s; 384 BC   March 7, 322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher. Student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. Aristotle and Plato are often considered as the two  most influential philosophers in Western thought. He wrote many books about physics, poetry, zoology, logic, government, and biology.

The three most influential ancient Greek philosophers were Aristotle, Plato (a teacher of Aristotle) and Socrates (ca. 470 BC-399 BC), whose thinking deeply influenced Plato. Among them they transformed Presocratic Greek philosophy into the foundations of Western philosophy as we know it. Socrates did not leave any writings, possibly as a result of the reasons articulated against writing philosophy attributed to him in Plato&apos;s dialogue Phaedrus. His ideas are known to us only indirectly, through Plato and a few other writers. The writings of Plato and Aristotle form the core of Ancient philosophy.
Aristotle, by contrast, placed much more value on knowledge gained from the senses and would correspondingly be better classed among modern empiricists (see materialism and empiricism). He also achieved a &quot;grounding&quot; of dialectic in the Topics by allowing interlocutors to begin from commonly held beliefs (Endoxa); his goal being non-contradiction rather than Truth. He set the stage for what would eventually develop into the scientific method centuries later. Although he wrote dialogues early in his career, no more than fragments of these have survived. The works of Aristotle that still exist today are in treatise form and were, for the most part, unpublished texts. These were probably lecture notes or texts used by his students, and were almost certainly revised repeatedly over the course of years. As a result, these works tend to be eclectic, dense and difficult to read. Among the most important ones are Physics, Metaphysics, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, De Anima (On the Soul) and Poetics.
Their works, although connected in many fundamental ways, are very different in both style and substance. Plato mainly wrote philosophical dialogues, that is, arguments in the form of conversations, usually with Socrates as a participant. Though the early dialogues are concerned mainly with methods of acquiring knowledge and most of the last ones with justice and practical ethics, his most famous works expressed a synoptic view of ethics, metaphysics, reason, knowledge and human life.  The fundamental idea of Plato is that knowledge gained through the senses is always confused and impure; true knowledge being acquired by the contemplative soul that turns away from the world. To attain such true knowledge, the philosopher must make use of the &quot;royal science&quot; of dialectic. One of the necessary obstacles of dialectic is dialogue itself which guides the interlocutors away from the paths to truth. The soul alone can have knowledge of the Forms, the real essences of things, of which the world we see is but an imperfect copy. Such knowledge has ethical as well as scientific importance. Plato can be called, with qualification, an idealist and a rationalist.

Aristotle is known for being one of the few figures in history who studied almost every subject possible at the time. In science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, embryology, geography, geology, meteorology, physics,and zoology. In philosophy, Aristotle wrote on aesthetics, economics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also dealt with education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works practically comprise an encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.

<h1> Biography </h1>
<h2>Early life and studies at the Academy</h2>
A bust of Aristotle is a nearly ubiquitous ornament in places of high culture in the West.

Aristotle was born at Stageira, a colony of Andros on the Macedonian peninsula of Chalcidice in 384 BC. His father, Nicomachus, was court physician to King Amyntas III of Macedon. It is believed that Aristotle&apos;s ancestors held this position under various kings of Macedonia. As such, Aristotle&apos;s early education would probably have consisted of instruction in medicine and biology from his father. About his mother, Phaestis, little is known. It is known that she died early in Aristotle&apos;s life. When Nicomachus also died, in Aristotle&apos;s tenth year, he was left an orphan and placed under the guardianship of his uncle, Proxenus of Atarneus. He taught Aristotle Greek, rhetoric, and poetry (O&apos;Connor et al., 2004). Aristotle was probably influenced by his father&apos;s medical knowledge; when he went to Athens at the age of 18, he was likely already trained in the investigation of natural phenomena.

From the age of 18 to 37 Aristotle remained in Athens as a pupil of Plato and distinguished himself at the Academy. The relations between Plato and Aristotle have formed the subject of various legends, many of which depict Aristotle unfavourably. No doubt there were divergences of opinion between Plato, who took his stand on sublime, idealistic principles, and Aristotle, who even at that time showed a preference for the investigation of the facts and laws of the physical world. It is also probable that Plato suggested that Aristotle needed restraining rather than encouragement, but not that there was an open breach of friendship. In fact, Aristotle&apos;s conduct after the death of Plato, his continued association with Xenocrates and other Platonists, and his allusions in his writings to Plato&apos;s doctrines prove that while there were conflicts of opinion between Plato and Aristotle, there was no lack of cordial appreciation or mutual forbearance. Besides this, the legends that reflect Aristotle unfavourably are traceable to the Epicureans, who were known as slanderers. If such legends were circulated widely by patristic writers such as Justin Martyr and Gregory Nazianzen, the reason lies in the exaggerated esteem Aristotle was held in by the early Christian heretics, not in any well-grounded historical tradition.

<h2>Aristotle as philosopher and tutor</h2>
After the death of Plato (347 BC), Aristotle was considered as the next head of the Academy, a post that was eventually awarded to Plato&apos;s nephew. Aristotle then went with Xenocrates to the court of Hermias, ruler of Atarneus in Asia Minor, and married his niece and adopted daughter, Pythia. In 344 BC, Hermias was murdered in a rebellion,   and Aristotle went with his family to Mytilene. It is also reported that he stopped  on Lesbos and briefly conducted biological research. Then, one or two years later, he was summoned to Pella, the Macedonian capital, by King Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor of Alexander the Great, who was then 13.

Plutarch wrote that Aristotle not only imparted to Alexander a knowledge of ethics and politics, but also of the most profound secrets of philosophy. We have much proof that Alexander profited by contact with the philosopher, and that Aristotle made prudent and beneficial use of his influence over the young prince (although Bertrand Russell disputes this). Due to this influence, Alexander provided Aristotle with ample means for the acquisition of books and the pursuit of his scientific investigation.

It is possible that Aristotle also participated in the education of Alexander&apos;s boyhood friends, which may have included for example Hephaestion and Harpalus. Aristotle maintained a long correspondence with Hephaestion, eventually collected into a book, unfortunately now lost.

According to sources such as Plutarch and Diogenes, Philip had Aristotle&apos;s hometown of Stageira burned during the 340s BC, and Aristotle successfully requested that Alexander rebuild it. During his tutorship of Alexander, Aristotle was reportedly considered a second time for leadership of the Academy; his companion Xenocrates was selected instead.

<h2>Founder and master of the Lyceum</h2>
In about 335 BC, Alexander departed for his Asiatic campaign, and Aristotle, who had served as an informal adviser (more or less) since Alexander ascended the Macedonian throne, returned to Athens and opened his own school of philosophy. He may, as Aulus Gellius says, have conducted a school of rhetoric during his former residence in Athens; but now, following Plato&apos;s example, he gave regular instruction in philosophy in a gymnasium dedicated to Apollo Lyceios, from which his school has come to be known as the Lyceum. (It was also called the Peripatetic School because Aristotle preferred to discuss problems of philosophy with his pupils while walking up and down -- peripateo -- the shaded walks -- peripatoi -- around the gymnasium).

During the thirteen years (335 BC 322 BC) which he spent as teacher of the Lyceum, Aristotle composed most of his writings. Imitating Plato, he wrote Dialogues in which his doctrines were expounded in somewhat popular language. He also composed the several treatises (which will be mentioned below) on physics, metaphysics, and so forth, in which the exposition is more didactic and the language more technical than in the Dialogues. These writings show to what good use he put the resources Alexander had provided for him. They show particularly how he succeeded in bringing together the works of his predecessors in Greek philosophy, and how he pursued, either personally or through others, his investigations in the realm of natural phenomena. Pliny claimed that Alexander placed under Aristotle&apos;s orders all the hunters, fishermen, and fowlers of the royal kingdom and all the overseers of the royal forests, lakes, ponds and cattle-ranges, and Aristotle&apos;s works on zoology make this statement more believable. Aristotle was fully informed about the doctrines of his predecessors, and Strabo asserted that he was the first to accumulate a great library.

During the last years of Aristotle&apos;s life the relations between him and Alexander became very strained, owing to the disgrace and punishment of Callisthenes, whom Aristotle had recommended to Alexander. Nevertheless, Aristotle continued to be regarded at Athens as a friend of Alexander and a representative of Macedonia. Consequently, when Alexander&apos;s death became known in Athens, and the outbreak occurred which led to the Lamian war, Aristotle shared in the general unpopularity of the Macedonians. The charge of impiety, which had been brought against Anaxagoras and Socrates, was now, with even less reason, brought against Aristotle. He left the city, saying (according to many ancient authorities) that he would not give the Athenians a chance to sin a third time against philosophy. He took up residence at his country house at Chalcis, in Euboea, and there he died the following year, 322 BC. His death was due to a disease, reportedly &apos;of the stomach&apos;, from which he had long suffered. The story that his death was due to hemlock poisoning, as well as the legend that he threw himself into the sea &quot;because he could not explain the tides,&quot; is without historical foundation.

Very little is known about Aristotle&apos;s personal appearance except from hostile sources. The statues and busts of Aristotle, possibly from the first years of the Peripatetic School, represent him as sharp and keen of countenance, and somewhat below the average height. His character as revealed by his writings, his will (which is undoubtedly genuine), fragments of his letters and the allusions of his unprejudiced contemporaries was that of a high-minded, kind-hearted man, devoted to his family and his friends, kind to his slaves, fair to his enemies and rivals, grateful towards his benefactors. When Platonism ceased to dominate the world of Christian speculation, and the works of Aristotle began to be studied without fear and prejudice, the personality of Aristotle appeared to the Christian writers of the 13th century, as it had to the unprejudiced pagan writers of his own day, as calm, majestic, untroubled by passion, and undimmed by any great moral defects, &quot;the master of those who know&quot;.

<h1> Methodology </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see Aristotle&apos;s theory of universals. 
Aristotle defines philosophy in terms of essence, saying that philosophy is &quot;the science of the universal essence of that which is actual&quot;. Plato had defined it as the &quot;science of the idea&quot;, meaning by idea what we should call the unconditional basis of phenomena. Both pupil and master regard philosophy as concerned with the universal; Aristotle, however, finds the universal in particular things, and called it the essence of things, while Plato finds that the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their prototype or exemplar. For Aristotle, therefore, philosophic method implies the ascent from the study of particular phenomena to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato philosophic method means the descent from a knowledge of universal ideas to a contemplation of particular imitations of those ideas. In a certain sense, Aristotle&apos;s method is both inductive and deductive, while Plato&apos;s is essentially deductive.

In Aristotle&apos;s terminology, the term natural philosophy corresponds to the phenomena of the natural world, which include: motion, light, and the laws of physics. Many centuries later these subjects would later become the basis of modern science, as studied through the scientific method. The term philosophy is distinct from metaphysics, which is what moderns term philosophy.

In the larger sense of the word, he makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also called &quot;science&quot;. Note, however, that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that which is covered by the scientific method.  &quot;All science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical.&quot; By practical science he understands ethics and politics; by poetical, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; while by theoretical philosophy he means physics, mathematics, and metaphysics.

The last, philosophy in the stricter sense, he defines as &quot;the knowledge of immaterial being,&quot; and calls it &quot;first philosophy&quot;, &quot;the theologic science&quot; or of &quot;being in the highest degree of abstraction.&quot; If logic, or, as Aristotle calls it, Analytic, be regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, we have as divisions of Aristotelian philosophy (1) Logic; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics, Mathematics, (3) Practical Philosophy; and (4) Poetical Philosophy.

<h1>Aristotle&apos;s epistemology</h1>
<h2>Logic</h2>
:Main article: Aristotelian logic 
:For more details on this topic, see Non-Aristotelian logic. 
<h3> History </h3>
Aristotle &quot;says that &apos;on the subject of reasoning&apos; he &apos;had nothing else on an earlier date to speak about&apos;&quot; (Boche ski, 1951). However, Plato reports that syntax was thought of before him, by Prodikos of Keos, who was concerned by the right use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from dialectics, the earlier philosophers used concepts like reductio ad absurdum as a rule when discussing, but never understood its logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic. Although he had the idea of constructing a system for deduction, he was never able to construct one. Instead, he relied on his dialectic, which was a confusion between different sciences and methods (Boche ski, 1951). Plato thought that deduction would simply follow from premises, so he focused on having good premises so that the conclusion would follow. Later on, Plato realised that a method for obtaining the conclusion would be beneficial. Plato never obtained such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book Sophist, where he introduced his division method (Rose, 1968).

<h3>Analytics and the Organon</h3>
What we call today Aristotelian logic, Aristotle himself would have labelled analytics. The term logic he reserved to mean dialectics. Most of Aristotle&apos;s work is probably not authentic, since it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books at about the time of Christ:
#Categories
#On Interpretation
#Prior Analytics
#Posterior Analytics
#Topics
#On Sophistical Refutations

The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle&apos;s writings. There is one volume of Aristotle&apos;s concerning logic not found in the Organon, namely the fourth book of Metaphysics. (Boche ski, 1951).

<h3>Modal logic</h3>
Aristotle is also the creator of syllogisms with modalities (modal logic). The word modal refers to the word &apos;modes&apos;, explaining the fact that modal logic deals with the modes of truth. Aristotle introduced the qualification of &apos;necessary&apos; and &apos;possible&apos; premises. He constructed a logic which helped in the evaluation of truth but which was very difficult to interpret. (Rose, 1968).

<h2>Science</h2>
Aristotelian discussions about science had only been qualitative, not quantitative. By the modern definition of the term, Aristotelian philosophy was not science, as this worldview did not attempt to probe how the world actually worked through experiment. For example, in his book The history of animals he claimed that human males have more teeth than female. Had he only made some observations, he would have found out that this claim is false.

Rather, based on what one&apos;s senses told one, Aristotelian philosophy then depended upon the assumption that man&apos;s mind could elucidate all the laws of the universe, based on simple observation (without experimentation) through reason alone.

One of the reasons for this was that Aristotle held that physics was about changing objects with a reality of their own, whereas mathematics was about unchanging objects without a reality of their own. In this philosophy, he could not imagine that there was a relationship between them.

In contrast, today&apos;s &quot;science&quot; assumes that thinking alone often leads people astray, and therefore one must compare one&apos;s ideas to the actual world through experimentation; only then can one see if one&apos;s ideas are based in reality. This position is known as empiricism or the scientific method.

<h1>Aristotle&apos;s metaphysics</h1>
<h2>Aristotle&apos;s four causes</h2>
Aristotle names four &quot;causes&quot; of things, but the word cause (Greek:        , aitia) is not used in the modern sense of &quot;cause and effect&quot;, under which causes are events or states of affairs. Rather, the four causes are like different ways of explaining something:
; The Material Cause (That from which it comes): This is the material that makes up an object, for example, &quot;the bronze and silver ... are causes of the statue and the bowl.&quot;
; The Formal Cause (That which it is): This is the blueprint or the idea commonly held of what an object should be. Aristotle says, &quot;The form is the account (and the genera of the account) of the essence (for instance, the cause of an octave is the ratio two to one, and in general number), and the parts that are in the account.&quot;
; The Efficient Cause (That which moves it): This is the person who makes an object, or &quot;unmoved movers&quot; (gods) who move nature. For example, &quot;a father is a cause of his child; and in general the producer is a cause of the product and the initiator of the change is a cause.&quot; This is closest to the modern definition of &quot;cause&quot;.
; The Final Cause (That of which its purpose is): The final cause or telos is the purpose or end that something is supposed to serve. This includes &quot;all the intermediate steps that are for the end ... for example, slimming, purging, drugs, or instruments are for health; all of these are for the end, though they differ in that some are activities while others are instruments.&quot;

An example of an artifact that has all four causes would be a table, which has material causes (wood and nails), a formal cause (the blueprint, or a generally agreed idea of what tables are), an efficient cause (the carpenter), and a final cause (using it to dine on).

Aristotle argues that natural objects such as an &quot;individual man&quot; have all four causes. The material cause of an individual man would be the flesh and bone that make up an individual man. The formal cause would be the blueprint of man, that which is used as a guide to create an individual man and to keep him in a certain state called man. The efficient cause of an individual man would be the father of that man, or in the case of all men an “unmoved mover” who breathed (anima: breath) into the soul (anima: soul) of man.  The final cause of man would be as Aristotle stated, “Now we take the human’s function to be a certain kind of life, and take this life to be the soul’s activity and actions that express reason.  Hence the excellent man’s function is to do this finely and well. Each function is completed well when its completion expresses the proper virtue. Therefore the human good turns out to be the souls’ activity that expresses virtue.”

<h2>The difference between natural objects and artifacts</h2>
The difference between natural objects and an artifact is that natural objects have self movement. Aristotle defined the difference between a natural object and an artifact when he stated, “In contrast to these, a bed, a cloak, or any other artifact-insofar as it is described as such i.e., as a bed, a cloak, or whatever, and to the extent that it is a product of a craft-has no innate impulse to change; but insofar as it is coincidentally made of stone or earth or a mixture of these, it has an innate impulse to change and just to that extent. This is because a nature is a type of principle and cause of motion and stability within those things to which it primarily belongs in their own right and not coincidentally.” The natural objects are changed to artifacts through crafts but they have an innate impulse of self movement to convert through time to their natural state, and they will all turn into that state when all animals with reason are extinct from the earth.

<h2>Modes of causation</h2>
Aristotle states two modes of causation:
*Proper Causation: Things take place for the sake of something, and the result is that which is intended.
*Accidental Causation: Things that take place not out of necessity. E.g. things that take place by chance/coincidence. This cause is indeterminable.

<h2>Chance</h2>
Chance lies in the realm of accidental causes. It is &quot;from what is spontaneous&quot; (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle&apos;s conception of &quot;chance&quot; it might be better to think of &quot;coincidence&quot;: Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place. For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.

However, chance can only apply to human beings. According to Aristotle, chance must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. &quot;What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance&quot; (Physics, 2.6).

<h2>The Four Elements</h2>
*Fire which is hot and dry.
*Earth which is cold and dry.
*Air which is hot and wet.
*Water which is cold and wet.

These four elements interchange (i.e. Fire   Air   Water   Earth   Fire, etc.). The Sun keeps this cycle going. God keeps the Sun going (and thus the Sun is eternal).

<h1> Aristotle&apos;s ethics </h1>
:Main article: Aristotelian ethics 
Although Aristotle wrote several works on ethics, the major one was the Nicomachean Ethics, which is considered one of Aristotle&apos;s greatest works; it discusses virtues. The ten books which comprise it are based on notes from his lectures at the Lyceum and were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle&apos;s son, Nicomachus.

Aristotle believed that ethical knowledge is not certain knowledge (like metaphysics and epistemology) but is general knowledge. Also, as it is not a theoretical discipline, he thought a person had to study in order to become &quot;good.&quot; Thus, if a person was to become virtuous, they could not simply study what virtue is, they had to actually do virtuous activity.  
In order to do this, Aristotle had to first establish what was virtuous.  He began by determining that everything was done with some goal in mind and that goal is &apos;good.&apos;  The ultimate goal he called the Highest Good.

Aristotle contested that happiness could not be found only in pleasure or only in fame and honor. He finally finds happiness &quot;by ascertaining the specific function of man. But what is this function that will bring happiness?  To determine this, Aristotle analyzed the soul and found it to have three parts: the Nutritive Soul (plants, animals and humans), the Perceptive Soul (animals and humans) and the Rational Soul (humans only).  Thus, a human&apos;s function is to do what makes it human, to be good at what sets it apart from everything else: the ability to reason or Nous. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfulling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.  Depending on how well they did this, Aristotle said people belonged to one of four categories: the Virtuous, the Continent, the Incontinent and the Vicious.

Aristotle believes that every ethical virtue is an intermediate condition between excess and deficiency. This does not mean Aristotle believed in moral relativism, however.  He set certain emotions (e.g., hate, envy, jealousy, spite, etc.) and certain actions (e.g., adultery, theft, murder, etc.) as being always wrong, regardless of the situation or the circumstances.

<h2>Nicomachean ethics</h2>
:Main article: Nichomachean Ethics 
In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle focuses on the importance of continually behaving virtuously and developing virtue rather than committing specific good actions. This can be opposed to Kantian ethics, in which the primary focus is on individual action. Nicomachean Ethics emphasizes the importance of context to ethical behaviour   what might be right in one situation might be wrong in another. Aristotle believed that happiness is the end of life and that as long as a person is striving for goodness, good deeds will result from that struggle, making the person virtuous and therefore happy.

<h1> Aristotle&apos;s critics </h1>
Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), a detail of The School of Athens, a fresco by Raphael.

Aristotle has been criticised on several grounds.

*At times, the objections that Aristotle raises against the arguments of his own teacher, Plato, appear to rely on faulty interpretations of those arguments.
*Although Aristotle advised, against Plato, that knowledge of the world could only be obtained through experience, he frequently failed to take his own advice. Aristotle conducted projects of careful empirical investigation, but often drifted into abstract logical reasoning, with the result that his work was littered with conclusions that were not supported by empirical evidence; for example, his assertion that objects of different mass fall at different speeds under gravity, which was later refuted by Galileo.
*In the Middle Ages, roughly from the 12th century to the 15th century, the philosophy of Aristotle became firmly established dogma. Although Aristotle himself was far from dogmatic in his approach to philosophical inquiry, two aspects of his philosophy might have assisted its transformation into dogma. His works were wide-ranging and systematic so that they could give the impression that no significant matter had been left unsettled. He was also much less inclined to employ the sceptical methods of his predecessors, Socrates and Plato.
*Some academics have suggested that Aristotle was unaware of much of the current science of his own time, and that he was a far lesser mathematician than many of his learned contemporaries.

Aristotle was called not a great philosopher, but &quot;The Philosopher&quot; by Scholastic thinkers. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods.

The Western mind is &quot;Aristotelian&quot;. By this we mean that it formats the external world into factual and &quot;scien&quot;-tific categories. (By &quot;Scien&quot;-tific we mean that something is knowable or known. Latin scientia = knowledge).

Under the premise of external categorization, the Aristotelian mind has come to equate &quot;experience&quot; with the unified chronical and spatial ontological structure that is the &quot;external&quot; universe -- visible, audible and sensible by the handful of our common, well-identified senses.

By so equating the two, the Aristotelian mind is fully confident, or fully &quot;positive&quot; of the meanings of its utterances and the purposes of all actions. That is to say, it dismisses the possibility of dubious meanings as interpreted by subjects that are at variance in perspectives or phenomenology, and it dismisses the importance of anything other than an objectively defined &quot;purpose&quot; to an action.

Therefore, the Aristotelian mind assumes that when subject A utters &quot;I am X,&quot; he or she is referring to the same experience and is expressing the same purpose as subject B who also utters &quot;I am X.&quot;

<h1> Bibliography </h1>
Note: Bekker numbers are often used to uniquely identify passages of Aristotle. They are identified below where available.

<h2> Major works </h2>
The extant works of Aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the Corpus Aristotelicum. Not all of these works are considered genuine, but differ with respect to their connection to Aristotle, his associates and his views. Some, such as the Athenaion Politeia or the fragments of other politeia are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle&apos;s &quot;school&quot; and compiled under his direction or supervision. Other works, such On Colours may have been products of Aristotle&apos;s successors at the Lyceum, e.g., Theophrastus and Straton. Still others acquired Aristotle&apos;s name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the De Plantis, possibly by Nicolaus of Damascus. A final category, omitted here, includes medieval palmistries, astrological and magical texts whose connection to Aristotle is purely fanciful and self-promotional. Those that are seriously disputed are marked with an asterisk.

:  An American In Paris is also a 1951 film musical starring Gene Kelly.

An American in Paris is a symphonic composition by American composer George Gershwin which debuted in 1928.  Inspired by Gershwin&apos;s time in Paris, it is in the form of an extended tone poem evoking the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s.  In addition to the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra, the score features period automobile horns; Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi-cab horns for the New York premiere of the composition.

* &quot;An American In Paris&quot; is second only to Rhapsody In Blue as a favorite of Gershwin&apos;s classical compositions.

* The score also features instruments rarely seen in the concert hall: celesta and saxophones.

Oscar Award
Although he never won an Oscar for any of his movie performances, the comedian Bob Hope received five honorary Oscars for contributions to cinema and humanitarian work.

The Academy Awards, commonly known as The Oscars, are the most prominent film awards in the United States.  The Awards are granted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, a professional honorary organization which as of 2003 had a voting membership of 5,816.  Actors (with a membership of 1,311) make up the largest voting bloc. The most recent awards were the 77th Academy Awards.

<h1>History</h1>
The Academy Awards were the brainchild of MGM executive Louis B. Mayer in 1927. The industry was in need of a touch of a class and a public-relations coup. The awards served this purpose. The awards were first given at a banquet in the Blossom Room of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on May 16, 1929. The evening included a banquet, dancing and the presentation of awards. The winners had been announced three months prior, eliminating all suspense. The whole presentation took five minutes, as there were no speeches.

To qualify, a film had to open in Los Angeles during the twelve months ending on July 31 of the preceding year. The 1934 and later awards have all been based on openings in the previous calendar year. The 1932 33 awards were based on a 17-month qualifying period. The &quot;opened in Los Angeles&quot; clause allowed Charlie Chaplin to win his only voted Oscar for Limelight which was made in 1952, but did not open until 1972. The rules have changed since then so films more than two years old are not eligible.

<h1>Name</h1>
The official name of the Oscar statuette is the &quot;Academy Award of Merit.&quot; Made of gold-plated britannium, it is 13.5 inches (34 cm) tall and depicts a knight holding a crusader&apos;s sword standing on a reel of film. The Academy Award statuette was allegedly nicknamed Oscar when Academy librarian Margaret Herrick saw it on a table and said, &quot;it looks just like my uncle Oscar!&quot; The nickname stuck and is used almost as commonly as Academy Award, even by the Academy itself. In fact, the Academy&apos;s domain name is oscars.org and the official website for the Academy Awards is at oscars.com.

<h1>Awards night</h1>
The awards night itself is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. The ceremony and extravagant afterparties, including the Academy&apos;s Governors Ball, are televised around the world.

<h1>Nominations</h1>
The members of each branch determine the nominees in their respective category, after which the entire membership votes for the winner in all categories. The ballot itself contains just the title of a work   not the persons involved   for all categories except acting.

Less subjectively, it is clear that movie studios spend large amounts of money on campaigning for their films. Around nomination and voting time, film trade publications are filled with ads headed &quot;For Your Consideration&quot;. Miramax has been the most widely discussed (and arguably successful) studio to use this technique.  An award can give a film a huge boost at the box office and make an artist an industry &quot;power player&quot; overnight.  In the past few decades, the advent of VHS and DVD have given Academy Awards a new level of importance, as the attachment of a win or even nomination in a prominent category can dramatically increase sales and rentals.  The Academy has made a public effort to crack down on these campaigns, but the results have been mixed.  Such influence is nothing new: for example, it is widely believed William Randolph Hearst ran a campaign to ensure that Citizen Kane   a film regarded by many as the greatest of all time   did not receive any Academy Award nominations. The film ended up receiving only one trophy despite nominations in nine categories.

<h1>Rules</h1>
Academy Award rules are reviewed annually.  Recent rule changes include the following:

*For 2003, the category names for the writing awards were simplified. The &quot;Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published&quot; category was renamed the &quot;Adapted Screenplay&quot; category. The category of &quot;Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen&quot; was renamed &quot;Original Screenplay.&quot;
*For 2002, a new category, Best Animated Feature, was established. 
*As of 2001, a film cannot appear on the Internet before its theatrical release and be eligible for an Oscar.
*In 2000 (and again in 2003), rules were tightened to restrict Best Picture nominations and awards to producers who actually functioned as producers.  Up to three producers are allowed per film.  The 1998 Best Picture Oscar went to five producers for Shakespeare in Love.
*The  &quot;Best Original Score&quot; category has been continually tweaked. In the mid 1990s, it was split into two (&quot;Best Dramatic Score&quot; and &quot;Best Comedy or Musical Score&quot;), then merged back into one. The rules as to how much of the score has to be &quot;original&quot; (as opposed to derived from other scores in the series, as with leitmotifs, for example in the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings films) has also been changed many times.

The greatest number of Academy Awards won by a film is 11, a distinction shared by 3 films: Ben-Hur, Titanic, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.

Temps Atomique International (TAI) or International Atomic Time is a very accurate and stable time scale.  It is a weighted average of the time kept by about 300 atomic clocks (including a large number of  caesium atomic clocks) in over 50 national laboratories worldwide.  It has been available since 1955, and became the international standard on which UTC is based on January 1, 1972, as decided by the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM). The International Bureau of Weights and Measures is in charge of the realization of TAI.

The highest precision realization of TAI times can only be determined retrospectively, as the timescale is defined by periodic comparisons among its participating atomic clocks. However, these corrections are usually only needed for applications that require nanosecond-scale accuracy.  Most time service users use realtime estimates of TAI provided by atomic clocks that have been previously referenced to the composite timescale.  GPS is a commonly-used realtime source of time traceable back to TAI.

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is the basis for legal time worldwide, and always differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds.  In mid 2005, UTC was behind TAI by 32 seconds.  The difference is due to leap seconds, which are periodically inserted into UTC due to slight irregularities in the Earth&apos;s rate of rotation.  While TAI is a continuous and stable timescale, UTC has intentional discontinuities to keep it from drifting more than 0.9 seconds from UT1, a timescale defined by the Earth&apos;s rotation.  Roughly speaking, solar noon (the time at which the sun is directly overhead) would drift away from 12:00:00 without leap second corrections.  UT1 is computed by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).  TAI was defined such that TAI = UT1 on January 1 1958.

Because UTC is a discontinuous timescale, it is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval.  Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead.  TAI is also commonly used by systems that can not handle leap seconds.

Altruism is either a practice or habit (in the view of many, a virtue) as well as an ethical doctrine. In Buddhism it can also be seen as a fundamental property of (human) nature.

Altruism can refer to:

* being helpful to other people with little or no interest in being rewarded for one&apos;s efforts (the colloquial definition). This is distinct from merely helping others.

* actions that benefit others with a net detrimental or neutral effect on the actor, regardless of the actor&apos;s own psychology, motivation, or the cause of her actions. This type of altruistic behavior is referred to in ecology as Commensalism.

* an ethical doctrine that holds that individuals have a moral obligation to help others, if necessary to the exclusion of one&apos;s own interest or benefit. One who holds such a doctrine is known as an &quot;altruist.&quot;

The concepts have a long history in philosophical and ethical thought, and have more recently become a topic for psychologists, sociologists, evolutionary biologists, and ethologists. While ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields lead to different perspectives on altruism.

<h1>Altruism in philosophy and ethics</h1>
The word &quot;altruism&quot; (French, altruisme, from autrui: &quot;other people&quot;, derived from Latin alter: &quot;other&quot;) was coined by Auguste Comte, the French founder of positivism, in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a moral obligation to serve the interest of others or the &quot;greater good&quot; of humanity. Comte says, in his Catechisme Positiviste, that &quot;[the] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This [&quot;to live for others&quot;], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely.&quot; As the name of the ethical doctrine is &quot;altruism,&quot; doing what the ethical doctrine prescribes has also come to be referred to by the term &quot;altruism&quot; -- serving others through placing their interests above one&apos;s own.

Comte asserts that individual rights are not compatible with the supposed obligation to serve others. Some argue that the ethical doctrine, if taken to its logical conclusion, leads to tyranny. Adolf Hitler is sometimes presented as an example of this, and has been described as advocating altruism . He says in Mein Kampf :
:&quot;The self-sacrificing will to give one&apos;s personal labor, and if necessary one&apos;s own life, for others is most strongly developed in the Aryan. The Aryan is not greatest in his mental qualities as such, but in the extent of his willingness to put all his abilities into the service of the community. In him the instinct of self-preservation has reached the noblest form, since he willingly subordinates his own ego to the life of the community and, if the hour demands, even sacrifices it.&quot;

However, the idea that one has a moral obligation to serve others is much older than Auguste Comte. For example, many of the world&apos;s oldest and most widespread religions (particularly Buddhism and Christianity) advocate it. In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, it is explained as follows:
:&quot;Jesus made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee. Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? And he said, He that showed mercy on him. And Jesus said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.&quot; (Luke 10: 30-37)

Philosophers who support egoism have argued that altruism is demeaning to the individual and that no moral obligation to help others actually exists. Nietzsche asserts that altruism is predicated on the assumption that others are more important than one&apos;s self. He also claims that it was very uncommon for people in Europe to consider the sacrifice of one&apos;s own interests for others as virtuous until after the advent of Christianity. However, this does not mean that Nietzsche did not believe in helping people. He simply believed that a person shouldn&apos;t be prevented from having painful, but necessary, life experiences. Ayn Rand argued that altruism is the willful sacrifice of one&apos;s values, and represents the reversal of morality because only a rationally selfish ethics allows one to pursue the values required for human life.

Advocates of altruism as an ethical doctrine maintain that one ought to act, or refrain from acting, so that benefit or good is bestowed on other people, if necessary to the exclusion of one&apos;s own interests (Note that refraining from murdering someone, for example, is not altruism since he is not receiving a benefit or being helped, as he already has his life; this would amount to the same thing as ignoring someone).

<h1>Altruism in ethology and evolutionary biology</h1>
In the science of ethology (the study of behavior), altruism refers to behavior by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. This would appear to be counter-intuitive if one presumes that natural selection acts on the individual. Natural selection, however, acts on the gene pool of the subjects, not on each subject individually. Recent developments in game theory have provided some explanations for apparent altruism, as have traditional evolutionary analyses. Among the proposed mechanisms are:

* Kin selection including eusociality (see also &quot;selfish gene&quot;)
* Reciprocal altruism, mutual aid
* Behavioral manipulation (e.g. by parasites)
* Indirect reciprocity (e.g. reputation)
* Bounded rationality (see e.g. Herbert Simon)
* Strong reciprocity
* Sexual selection

The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind George R. Price&apos;s development of the Price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds, such as Dictyostelium mucoroides. These protists live as individual amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body. Social behavior and altruism share many similaraties to the interactions between the many parts (cells, genes) of an organism, but are distinguished by the ability of each individual to reproduce indefinitely without an absolute requirement for its neighbors.

<h1>Altruism in psychology and sociology</h1>
If one performs an act beneficial to others with a view to gaining some personal benefit, then it is not an altruistically motivated act. There are several different perspectives on how &quot;benefit&quot; (or &quot;interest&quot;) should be defined. A material gain (e.g. money, a physical reward, etc.) is clearly a form of benefit, while others identify and include both material and immaterial gains (affection, respect, happiness, satisfaction etc.) as being philosophically identical benefits.

According to psychological egoism, while people can exhibit altruistic behavior, they cannot have altruistic motivations. Psychological egoists would say that while they might very well spend their lives benefitting others with no material benefit (or a material net loss) to themselves, their most basic motive for doing so is always to further their own interests. For example, it would be alleged that the foundational motive behind a person acting this way is to advance their own psychological well-being. Critics of this theory often reject it on the grounds that it is non-falsifiable; in other words, it is designed in such a way as to be impossible to prove or disprove. It has also been accused of using circular logic: &quot;If a person willingly performs an act, that means he derives personal enjoyment from it; therefore, people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment&quot;. This statement is circular because its conclusion is identical to its hypothesis (it assumes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment, and concludes that people only perform acts that give them personal enjoyment).

In contrast to psychological egoism, the empathy-altruism hypothesis states that when an individual experiences empathy towards someone in need, the individual will then be altruistically motivated to help that person; that is, the individual will be primarily concerned about that person&apos;s welfare, not his or her own.

In common parlance, altruism usually means helping another person without expecting material reward from that or other persons, although it may well entail the &quot;internal&quot; benefit of a &quot;good feeling,&quot; sense of satisfaction, self-esteem, fulfillment of duty (whether imposed by a religion or ideology or simply one&apos;s conscience), or the like. In this way one need not speculate on the motives of the altruist in question.

Humans are not exclusively altruistic towards family members, previous co-operators or potential future allies, but can be altruistic towards people they don&apos;t know and will never meet.  For example, humans donate to international charities and volunteer their time to help society&apos;s less fortunate.

It strains plausibility to claim that these altruistic deeds are done in the hope of a return favor. The game theory analysis of this &apos;just in case&apos; strategy, where the principle would be &apos;always help everyone in case you need to pull in a favor in return&apos;, is a decidedly non-optimal strategy, where the net expenditure of effort (tit) is far greater than the net profit when it occasionally pays off (tat).

According to some, it is difficult to believe that these behaviors are solely explained as indirect selfish rationality, be it conscious or sub-conscious. Mathematical formulations of kin selection, along the lines of the prisoner&apos;s dilemma, are helpful as far as they go; but what a game-theoretic explanation glosses over is the fact that altruistic behavior can be attributed to that apparently mysterious phenomenon, the conscience. One recent suggestion, proposed by the philosopher Daniel Dennett, was initially developed when considering the problem of so-called &apos;free riders&apos; in the tragedy of the commons, a larger-scale version of the prisoner&apos;s dilemma.

In game theory terms, a free rider is an agent who draws benefits from a co-operative society without contributing. In a one-to-one situation, free riding can easily be discouraged by a tit-for-tat strategy. But in a larger-scale society, where contributions and benefits are pooled and shared, they can be incredibly difficult to shake off.

Imagine an elementary society of co-operative organisms. Co-operative agents interact with each other, each contributing resources and each drawing on the common good. Now imagine a rogue free rider, an agent who draws a favor (&quot;you scratch my back&quot;) and later refuses to return it. The problem is that free riding is always going to be beneficial to individuals at cost to society. How can well-behaved co-operative agents avoid being cheated? Over many generations, one obvious solution is for co-operators to evolve the ability to spot potential free riders in advance and refuse to enter into reciprocal arrangements with them. Then, the canonical free rider response is to evolve a more convincing disguise, fooling co-operators into co-operating after all. This can lead to an evolutionary arms races, with ever-more-sophisticated disguises and ever-more-sophisticated detectors.

In this evolutionary arms race, how best might one convince comrades that one really is a genuine co-operator, not a free rider in disguise?  One answer is by actually making oneself a  genuine co-operator, by erecting psychological barriers to breaking promises, and by advertising this fact to everyone else. In other words, a good solution is for organisms to evolve things that everyone knows will force them to be co-operators - and to make it obvious that they&apos;ve evolved these things. So evolution will produce organisms who are sincerely moral and who wear their hearts on their sleeves; in short, evolution will give rise to the phenomenon of conscience.

This theory, combined with ideas of kin selection and the one-to-one sharing of benefits, may explain how a blind and fundamentally selfish process can produce a genuinely non-cynical form of altruism that gives rise to the human conscience.

Critics of such technical game theory analysis point out that it appears to forget that human beings are rational and emotional. To presume an analysis of human behaviour without including human rationale or  emotion is necessarily unrealistically narrow, and treats human beings as if they are mere machines.

Beginning with an understanding that rational human beings benefit from living in a benign universe, logically it follows that particular human beings may gain substantial emotional satisfaction from acts which they perceive to make the world a better place.

<h1>Altruism in politics</h1>
If one is an adherent to the ethical doctrine called altruism (that people have an ethical obligation to help or further the welfare of others), it can become a moral justification for forcing, or advocating forcing individuals to help others. In the realm of politics, the altruist may employ an agent in the form of government to enforce this supposed moral obligation. This is not to say that an ethical altruist will necessarily force this on anyone. An altruist may allow others the freedom to behave in a manner they believe to be immoral or selfish. In other words, their ethical doctrine would not manifest itself politically.

With regard those who believe benevolence is a moral obligation, altruists may be divided in two broad groups: Those who believe helping others is a moral obligation but should not be enforced on individuals. And, those who believe that since helping others is a moral obligation, forcing individuals to help others if they are not willing on their own is justified.

A prominent example of the former branch of altruist political thought is Lysander Spooner, who, in Natural Law, writes: &quot;Man, no doubt, owes many other moral duties to his fellow men; such as to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, shelter the homeless, care for the sick, protect the defenceless, assist the weak, and enlighten the ignorant. But these are simply moral duties, of which each man must be his own judge, in each particular case, as to whether, and how, and how far, he can, or will, perform them.&quot;

The latter branch of altruist political thought, on the other hand, argues that egoism should be actively discouraged, and that individuals should be forced to help other people. Thus, in politics, these altruists almost always take a left-wing stance, ranging from moderate social democracy to socialism or even communism. Moderate altruists of this branch may argue for the creation of taxation-funded government programs aimed at benefiting the needy (for example transfer payments, such as social welfare, or public healthcare and public education). Finally, radical altruists of this branch may take things to an extreme and advocate some form of state-enforced collectivism, communalism, or communism. This is in line with August Comte&apos;s philosophy (who coined the term altruism), which argues against individual rights.

Finally, many believe that helping others or serving society is not a moral obligation at all, but that altrusm is an arbitrary pronouncement not philosophically derivable. These oppose all government-enforced charity. Individualist anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1847 warns of enforcing charity: &quot;That is why charity, the prime virtue of the Christian, the legitimate hope of the socialist, the object of all the efforts of the economist, is a social vice the moment it is made a principle of constitution and a law; that is why certain economists have been able to say that legal charity had caused more evil in society than proprietary usurpation&quot; (The Philosophy of Poverty).

On a somewhat related note, altruism is often held - even by non-altruists - to be the kind of ethic that should guide the actions of politicians and other people in positions of power. Such people are usually expected to set their own interests aside and serve the populace. When they do not, they may be criticized as defaulting on what is believed to be an ethical obligation to place the interests of others above their own.

Ang Lee (Chinese:   ; pinyin:  L   n  ) (born October 23, 1954) is an ethnic Chinese Hollywood director born and raised in Taiwan but educated in the United States. Many of his films have focused on the interactions between modernity and tradition.

His films have also tended to have a light-hearted comedic tone which marks a break from the tragic historical realism which characterized Taiwanese filmmaking after the end of the martial law period in 1987. He created the gay genre in Asian films, and also created the A-list Hollywood wuxia film.

He is highly educated, having completed his bachelor&apos;s degree in Theater from the University of Illinois and received his MFA from New York University&apos;s Tisch School of the Arts, where in 1984 he made a thesis film called Fine Line. He was also classmates with Spike Lee. He was a Visiting Fellow at Dartmouth College in 2001 where he premiered Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. His most recent films, Hulk and Brokeback Mountain, have been lauded for their artistic originality.  Ang Lee&apos;s latest film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005) won the best film award in Venice International Film Festival.

Novelist and philosopher, best known for her philosophy of Objectivism

Ayn Rand (February 2 1905 March 6 1982; first name pronounced (IPA)  /aɪn/  (rhymes with &apos;mine&apos;)), born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum, was best known for her philosophy of Objectivism and her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. Her philosophy and her fiction both emphasize, above all, her concepts of individualism, rational egoism (&quot;rational self-interest&quot;), and capitalism. Believing government has a legitimate but relatively minimal role in a free society, she was not an anarchist, but a minarchist (though she did not use the term &quot;minarchist&quot;). Her novels were based upon the archetype of the Randian hero, a man whose ability and independence causes conflict with the masses, but who perseveres nevertheless to achieve his values. Rand viewed this hero as the ideal and made it the express goal of her literature to showcase such heroes. She believed:
#That man must choose his values and actions by reason; 
#That the individual has a right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing self to others nor others to self; and 
#That no one has the right to seek values from others by physical force, or impose ideas on others by physical force.

<h1> Biography </h1>

<h2> Early life </h2>

Rand was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and was the eldest of three daughters of a Jewish family. Her parents were agnostic and largely non-observant. From an early age, she displayed a strong interest in literature and films. She started writing screenplays and novels from the age of seven. Her mother undertook to teach her French and subscribed to a magazine featuring stories for boys, where Rand found her first childhood hero: Cyrus Paltons, an Indian army officer in a Rudyard Kipling-style story called &quot;The Mysterious Valley&quot;. Throughout her youth, she read the novels of Sir Walter Scott, Alexandre Dumas and other Romantic writers, and expressed a passionate enthusiasm toward the Romantic movement as a whole. She discovered Victor Hugo at the age of thirteen, and fell deeply in love with his novels. Later, she would cite him as her favourite novelist and the greatest novelist of world literature. She studied philosophy and history at the University of Petrograd. Her major literary discoveries in university were the works of Edmond Rostand, Friedrich Schiller and Fyodor Dostoevsky. She admired Rostand for his richly romantic imagination and Schiller for his grand, heroic scale. She admired Dostoevsky for his sense of drama and his intense moral judgments, but was deeply against his philosophy and his sense of life. She continued to write short stories and screenplays and wrote sporadically in her diary, which contained intensely anti-Soviet ideas. She also encountered the philosophical ideas of Nietzsche, and loved his exaltation of the heroic and independent individual in Thus Spoke Zarathustra; nevertheless she was strongly critical of his philosophy, going so far as to attack it in the introductions of her novels. Her greatest influence by far is Aristotle, especially his work Organon (Logic). She considered him the greatest philosopher ever. She then entered the State Institute for Cinema Arts in 1924 to study screenwriting; in late 1925, however, she was granted a visa to visit American relatives. She arrived in the United States in February 1926, at the age of twenty-one. After a brief stay with her relatives in Chicago, she resolved never to return to the Soviet Union, and set out for Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. She then changed her name to &quot;Ayn Rand&quot;. There is a story told that she named herself after the Remington Rand typewriter, but recent evidence has proved that this is not the case. She stated that her first name, &apos;Ayn&apos;, was an adaptation of the name of a Finnish writer. This may have been the Finnish-Estonian author Aino Kallas.

<h2> Major works </h2>

Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. While working as an extra on Cecil B. DeMille&apos;s King of Kings, she intentionally bumped into an aspiring young actor, Frank O&apos;Connor, who caught her eye. The two were married in 1929. In 1931, Rand became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Her first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn in 1932 to Universal Studios. Rand then wrote the play The Night of January 16th in 1934, which was highly successful, and published two novels, We the Living (1936), and Anthem (1938). The two novels failed to gain any significant financial/critical success. She was up against the Red Decade in America, and Anthem did not even find a publisher in the United States; it was first published in England. Besides that, Rand had still not perfected her literary style and the novels cannot be considered to be fully representative.

Without Rand&apos;s knowledge or permission, We The Living was made into a pair of films, Noi vivi and Addio, Kira in 1942 by Scalara Films, Rome. The films were nearly censored by the Italian government under Benito Mussolini, but they were allowed to be featured because the novel they were based upon was ostensibly anti-Soviet. The films were successful and the public easily realised that it was as much against Fascism as it was against Communism, and the government banned it quickly  thereafter. These films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as We the Living in 1986.

Rand&apos;s first major professional success came with her best-selling novel The Fountainhead (1943). She took seven years to write it. The novel was rejected by twelve publishers, who thought it was too intellectual and opposed to the mainstream of American thought, and that there would be no public for it. It was finally accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company publishing house, thanks mainly to a member of the editorial board, Archibald Ogden, who praised the book in the highest terms and finally prevailed.  Despite these initial struggles The Fountainhead was a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security.

The theme of The Fountainhead is &quot;individualism and collectivism in man&apos;s soul&quot;. It features the life of five main characters. The hero, Howard Roark, is Rand&apos;s ideal, a noble soul par excellence, an architect who is firmly and serenely devoted to his own ideals and believes that no man should copy the style of another in any field, and especially in architecture. All the other characters in the novel demand the renunciation of his values with varying degrees of intensity, but Roark maintains his integrity. A most interesting feature of Roark is that he does this unlike traditional heroes who launch into long and passionate monologues about their integrity and the unfairness of the world; Roark, by contrast, does it with a disdainful, almost contemptous taciturnity and laconicism.

Rand&apos;s magnum opus, Atlas Shrugged, was published in 1957, becoming an international bestseller. Atlas Shrugged is often seen as Rand&apos;s most complete statement of the Objectivist philosophy in any of her works of fiction. In its appendix, she offered this summary:
:&quot;My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot;

The theme of Atlas Shrugged is &quot;The role of man&apos;s mind in society&quot;. Rand upheld the industrialist as one of the most admirable members of any society and fiercely opposed the popular resentment accorded to industrialists. This led her to envision a novel wherein the industrialists of America go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway. The American economy and its society in general slowly start to collapse. The government responds by increasing the already stifling controls on industrial concerns. The novel, despite having a political theme at its centre, deals with issues as complex and divergent as sex, music, medicine, and human ability.

Along with Nathaniel Branden, his wife Barbara, and others including Alan Greenspan and Leonard Peikoff, (jokingly designated &quot;The Collective&quot;), Rand launched the Objectivist movement to promote her philosophy.

<h2> The Objectivist movement </h2>

Main article: The Objectivist movement

In 1950 Rand moved to New York City, where in  1951 she met the young psychology student Nathaniel Branden , who had read her book The Fountainhead at the age of 14. Branden, then 19, enjoyed discussing Rand&apos;s emerging Objectivist philosophy with her. Together, Branden and some of his other friends formed a group that they dubbed the Ayn Rand Collective, which included future Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. After several years, Rand and Branden&apos;s friendly relationship blossomed into a romantic affair despite the fact that both were married at the time. This affair was cleared with their spouses but led to the separation and then divorce of Nathaniel Branden from his wife.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through both her fiction  and non-fiction  works, and by giving talks at several east-coast universities, largely through the Nathaniel Branden Institute (&quot;the NBI&quot;) which Branden had established to promote her philosophy.

After a convoluted series of separations, Rand abruptly ended her relationship with both Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara Branden in 1968 when she learned of Nathaniel Branden&apos;s affair with Patrecia Scott (this later affair did not overlap chronologically with the earlier Branden/Rand affair).  Rand refused to have any further dealings with the NBI.  Rand then published a letter in &quot;The Objectivist&quot; announcing her repudiation of Branden for various reasons, including dishonesty, but did not mention their affair or her role in the schism. The two never reconciled, and Branden remained a persona non grata in the Objectivist movement.

Barbara Branden presented an account of the breakup of the affair in her book, The Passion of Ayn Rand. She describes the encounter between Nathaniel and Rand, saying that Rand slapped him numerous times, and denounced him in these words: &quot;If you have an ounce of morality left in you, an ounce of psychological health — you&apos;ll be impotent for the next twenty years! And if you achieve any potency, you&apos;ll know it&apos;s a sign of still worse moral degradation!&quot;

Conflicts continued in the wake of the break with Branden and the subsequent collapse of the NBI. Many of her closest &quot;Collective&quot; friends began to part ways, and during the late 70&apos;s her activities within the formal Objectivist movement began to decline, a situation which increased after the death of her husband in 1979. One of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged.

Rand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982 in New York City, years after having successfully battled cancer, and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.

<h2> Philosophical influences </h2>

Rand rejected virtually all other philosophical schools. She acknowledged a shared intellectual lineage with Aristotle and John Locke, and more generally with the philosophy of the Age of Enlightenment and Age of Reason.  She occasionally remarked with approval on specific philosophical positions of, e.g., Baruch Spinoza and Thomas Aquinas. She seems also to have respected the American rationalist Brand Blanshard. However, she regarded most philosophers as at best incompetent and at worst positively evil. She singled out Immanuel Kant as the most influential of the latter sort.

Nonetheless, there are connections between Rand&apos;s views and those of other philosophers. She acknowledged that she had been influenced at an early age by the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche. Though she later repudiated his thought, and reprinted her first novel, We The Living, with some wording changes in 1959, her own thought grew out of critical interaction with it.  Generally, her political thought is in the tradition of classical liberalism. She expressed qualified enthusiasm for the economic thought of Ludwig von Mises and Henry Hazlitt. Later Objectivists, such as Richard Salsman, have claimed that Rand&apos;s economic theories are implicitly more supportive of the doctrines of Jean-Baptiste Say, though Rand herself was likely not acquainted with his work.

<h2> Politics and House Committee on Un-American Activities testimony </h2>

Rand&apos;s political views were radically anti-communist, anti-statist, and pro-capitalist. Her writings praised above all the human individual and the creative genius of which one is capable.  She exalted what she saw as the heroic American values of egoism and individualism.  Rand also had a strong dislike for mysticism, religion, and compulsory charity (forced extraction), all of which she believed helped foster a crippling culture of resentment towards individual human happiness and success.

In 1947, during the infamous Red Scare, Rand testified as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. . Rand&apos;s testimony involved analysis of the 1943 film Song of Russia. While many believe that Ayn Rand disclosed the names of members of the Communist Party in the U.S., thus exposing them to blacklisting, her testimony consisted entirely of comments regarding the disparity between her experiences in the Soviet Union and the fanciful portrayal of it in the film.

Rand argued that the movie grossly misrepresented the socioeconomic conditions in the Soviet Union. She told the committee that the film presented life in the USSR as being much better than it actually was. Apparently this 1943 film was intentional wartime propaganda by U.S. patriots, trying to put their Soviet allies in World War II under the best possible light. After the HUAC hearings, when Ayn Rand was asked about her feelings on the effectiveness of their investigations, she described the process as &quot;futile.&quot;

<h1> Legacy </h1>

Rand&apos;s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A six-foot floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed on her casket.

In 1985, Leonard Peikoff, a surviving member of &quot;The Collective&quot; and Ayn Rand&apos;s designated heir, established &quot;The Ayn Rand Institute: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism&quot;. The Institute has since registered the name Ayn Rand as a trademark, despite Rand&apos;s desire that her name never be used to promote the philosophy she developed. Rand expressed her wish to keep her name and the philosophy of Objectivism separate to ensure the survival of her ideas.

Another schism in the movement occurred in 1989, when Objectivist David Kelley wrote an article called &quot;A Question of Sanction,&quot;  in which he defended his choice to speak to non-Objectivist libertarian groups. Kelley wrote that Objectivism was not a &quot;closed system&quot; and should engage with other philosophies. Peikoff, in an article for The Intellectual Activist called &quot;Fact and Value&quot; , argued that Objectivism is, indeed, a closed system, and that truth and moral goodness are intrinsically related. Peikoff expelled Kelley from his movement, whereupon Kelley founded The Institute for Objectivist Studies (now known as &quot;The Objectivist Center&quot;).

Rand and Objectivism are less well known outside North America, though there are pockets of interest in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and her novels are reported to be very popular in India (). Her work has had little effect on academic philosophy, for her followers are mostly (with some notable exceptions) drawn from the non-academic world.

<h1> Controversy </h1>

Rand and her philosophy of Objectivism have been subject to various criticisms. In the realm of analytic philosophy, however, it is more accurate to say that Rand&apos;s work has been mostly ignored. University departments considered leaders in the field of analytic philosophy pay scant attention to her work. For example, a study of well-regarded departments in both the analytic and Continental philosophy traditions, produced by Brian Leiter, reveals not one department that considers an acquaintance with Rand&apos;s work a prerequisite for the Ph.D. Some academics, however, are bringing her work into the mainstream. One sign of this is the existence of the Ayn Rand Society , founded in 1987, an organization of academic philosophers that is affiliated with the American Philosophical Association.

A notable exception to the general lack of attention paid to Rand in the analytic philosophy community is the essay &quot;On the Randian Argument&quot; by Harvard University philosopher Robert Nozick, which appears in his collection Socratic Puzzles. Nozick&apos;s own libertarian political conclusions are similar to Rand&apos;s, but his essay is critical of her argument, and he accuses her of inadequately handling several important issues in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. For example, he argues that her solution to David Hume&apos;s famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. Rand holds that preserving one&apos;s own life is objectively the highest value because it makes all other values possible. Nozick says that to make this argument sound, she still needs to explain why someone could not rationally prefer the state of eventually dying and having no values. Thus, he argues, her attempt to deduce the morality of selfishness is essentially an instance of assuming the conclusion or begging the question. Nevertheless, Nozick did respect Rand as an author and noted that he found her books enjoyable and thought-provoking.

Rand has sometimes been viewed with suspicion for her practice of presenting her philosophy in fiction and non-fiction books aimed at a general audience rather than publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Rand&apos;s defenders note that she is part of a long tradition of authors who wrote philosophically rich fiction — including Dante, John Milton, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Albert Camus, and that other philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre presented their philosophies in both fictional and non-fictional forms.

Other critics argue that Rand’s idealistic philosophy and her Romantic literary style are not applicable to the inhabited world. In particular, those critics have claimed that Rand&apos;s novels are made up of one-dimensional characters. They dislike that most of the Objectivist heroes are incredibly intelligent and unencumbered by doubt. Some of the heroes are very rich. Others seem to have no shortcomings at all — especially Howard Roark, the hero of The Fountainhead . The antagonists are often weak, pathetic, full of uncertainty, and lacking in imagination and talent.

Defenders of Rand respond with counterexamples from her novels to show her range of characterization: Neither Eddie Willers nor Cherryl Taggart is especially gifted or intelligent, but both are characters of dignity and respect; Leo Kovalensky suffers enormously due to his inability to cope with the brutality and banality of communism; Andrei Taganov dies after realizing his philosophical errors; Dominique Francon is initially bitterly unhappy because she believes evil is powerful; and Dagny Taggart thinks that she is capable of saving the world alone. Nor are all of her heroes rich: Howard Roark, Hank Rearden, and John Galt started out poor. Moreover, Hank Rearden is exploited because of his social naïveté. As for the purportedly weak and pathetic villains, Rand&apos;s defenders point out that Ellsworth Toohey is represented as being a great strategist and communicator from an early age, and Dr. Robert Stadler is a brilliant scientist.

Rand herself replied to the criticism (and in advance of much of it) with her essay &quot;The Goal of My Writing&quot; (1963). There, and in other essays collected in her book The Romantic Manifesto: A Philosophy of Literature (2nd rev. ed. 1975), Rand makes it clear that her goal is to project her vision of an ideal man: not man as he is, but man as he might and ought to be.

Alain Connes (born April 1, 1947) is a French mathematician, currently Professor at the College de France (Paris, France), IHES (Bures-sur-Yvette, France) and Vanderbilt University (Nashville, Tennessee). He is a specialist of Von Neumann algebras and succeeded in completing the classification of factors of these objects.

The remarkable links between this subject, the tools he and others devised to tackle the problem and other subjects in theoretical physics, particle physics, and differential geometry, made him emphasize Noncommutative geometry (which is also the title of his major book to date).

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982, the Crafoord Prize in 2001 and the gold medal of the CNRS in 2004.

Allan Dwan (April 3, 1885   December 21, 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

Born Joseph Aloysius Dwan in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, his family moved to the United States when he was eleven years of age. At university, he trained as an engineer and began working for a lighting company in Chicago, Illinois. However, he had  a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when Essanay Studios offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job. At that time, some of the East Coast movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the Motion Picture Directors Association.

Allan Dwan became a true innovator in the motion picture industry. After making a series of westerns and comedies,  he directed fellow Canadian, Mary Pickford in several very successful movies as well as her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, notably in the acclaimed 1922 Robin Hood.

Following the introduction of the talkies, in 1937 he directed child-star Shirley Temple in Heidi and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm the following year.

Over his long and successful career spanning over fifty years, he directed over 400 motion pictures, many of them highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office smash, The Sands of Iwo Jima. His last movie was in 1961.

Dwan is one of the directors who spanned the silent to sound era. Most of the silent movies he directed are lost due to poor preservation. Little historical writing has been devoted to Dwan, but some believe that he will be the last &quot;discovered&quot; great director from the Classic Hollywood Era.

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, Mission Hills, California.

Allan Dwan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6263 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

In the economy of Algeria the hydrocarbons sector is the backbone, accounting for roughly 52% of budget revenues, 25% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves. Algiers&apos; efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the Arab world stalled in 1992 as the country became embroiled in political turmoil.

Burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund in April 1994 and the following year signed onto a three-year extended fund facility which ended April 30, 1998. Some progress on economic reform, Paris Club debt reschedulings in 1995 and 1996, and oil and gas sector expansion contributed to a recovery in growth since 1995, reducing inflation to approximately 1% and narrowing the budget deficit. Algeria&apos;s economy has grown at about 4% annually since 1999. The country&apos;s foreign debt has fallen from a high of $28 billion in 1999 to its current level of $24 billion. The spike in oil prices in 1999-2000 and the government&apos;s tight fiscal policy, as well as a large increase in the trade surplus and the near tripling of foreign exchange reserves has helped the country&apos;s finances. However, an ongoing drought, the after effects of the November 10, 2001 floods and an uncertain oil market make prospects for 2002-03 more problematic. The government pledges to continue its efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector. However, it has thus far had little success in reducing high unemployment, officially estimated at 30% and improving living standards.

President Bouteflika has announced sweeping economic reforms, which, if implemented, will significantly restructure the economy. Still, the economy remains heavily dependent on volatile oil and gas revenues. The government has continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector, but has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards.  Other priority areas include banking reform, improving the investment environment, and reducing government bureaucracy.

The government has announced plans to sell off state enterprises: sales of a national cement factory and steel plant have been completed and other industries are up for offer. In 2001, Algeria signed an Association Agreement with the European Union; it has started accession negotiations for entry into the World Trade Organization.

<h2>Agriculture</h2>

Since Roman times Algeria has been noted for the fertility of its soil.  About a quarter of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits.  More than 7,500,000 acres (30,000 km ) are devoted to the cultivation of cereal grains.  The Tell is the grain-growing land.  During the time of French rule its productivity was increased substantially by the sinking of artesian wells in districts which only required water to make them fertile.  Of the crops raised, wheat, barley and oats are the principal cereals.  A great variety of vegetables and of fruits, especially citrus products, is exported.

A considerable amount of cotton was grown at the time of the United States&apos; Civil War, but the industry declined afterwards.  In the early years of the 20th century efforts to extend the cultivation of the plant were renewed.  A small amount of cotton is also grown in the southern oases.  Large quantities of crin vegetal (vegetable horse-hair) an excellent fibre, are made from the leaves of the dwarf palm.  The olive (both for its fruit and Petroleum) and tobacco are cultivated with great success.

Algeria also exports figs, dates, esparto grass, and cork.

<h3>Wine Production</h3>

Throughout Algeria the soil of favours the growth of vines.  The country, in the words of an expert sent to report on the subject by the French government, 
:&quot;can produce an infinite variety of wines suitable to every constitution and to every caprice of taste.&quot;

The growing of vines was undertaken early by the colonists, but it was not until vineyards in France were attacked by phylloxera that the export of wine from Algeria became significant.  In 1883, despite precautionary measures, Algerian vineyards were also attacked but in the meantime the quality of their wines had been proved.  In 1850 less than 2000 acres (8 km ) were devoted to the grape, but in 1878 this had increased to over 42,000 acres (170 km ), which yielded 7,436,000 gallons (28,000 m ) of wine.  Despite bad seasons and ravages of insects, cultivation extended, and in 1895 the vineyards covered 300,000 acres (1,200 km ), the produce being 88,000,000 gallons (333,000 m ).  The area of cultivation in 1905 exceeded 400,000 acres (1,600 km ), and in that year the amount of wine produced was 157,000,000 gallons (594,000 m ).  By that time the limits of profitable production had been reached in many parts of the country.  Practically the only foreign market for Algerian wine is France, which in 1905 imported about 110,000,000 gallons (416,000 m ).

<h2>Fishing</h2>

Fishing is a flourishing but minor industry.  Fish caught are principally sardines, bonito, smelt and sprats.  Fresh fish are exported to France, dried and preserved fish to Spain and Italy.  Coral fisheries are found along the coast from Bona to Tunis.

<h2>Minerals</h2>

Algeria is rich in minerals; the country has many iron, lead and zinc, copper, calamine, antimony and mercury mines.  The most productive are those of iron and zinc.  Lignite is found in Algiers; immense phosphate beds were discovered near Tebessa in 1891, yielding 313,500 tons in 1905.  Phosphate beds are also worked near Setif, Guelma and Ain Beida.  There are more than 300 quarries which produce, amongst other stones, onyx and beautiful white and red marbles.  Algerian onyx from Ain Tekbalet was used by the Romans, and many ancient quarries have been found near Kleber, some being certainly those from which the long-lost Numidian marbles were taken.  Salt is collected on the margins of the chotts.

<h1>Foreign Trade</h1>

Under French administration the commerce of Algeria developed greatly: the total imports and exports at the time of the French occupation (1830) did not exceed £ 175,000.  In 1850 the figures had reached £ 5,000,000; in 1868, £ 12,000,000; in 1880, £ 17,000,000; and in 1890, £ 20,000,000.  From this point progress was slower and the figures varied considerably year by year.  In 1905 the total value of the foreign trade was £ 24,500,000.  About five-sixths of the trade is with or via France, into which country several Algerian goods have been admitted duty-free since 1851, and all since 1867.  French goods, except sugar, have been admitted into Algeria without payment of duty since 1835.  After the increase, in 1892, of the French minimum tariff, which applied to Algeria also, foreign trade greatly diminished.

By far Algeria&apos;s most significant exports, financially, are petroleum and natural gas.  The reserves are mostly in the Eastern Sahara; the Algerian government curbed the exports in the 1980s to slow depletion; exports increased again somewhat in the 1990s.  Other significant exports are sheep, oxen, and horses; animal products, such as wool and skins; wine, cereals (rye, barley, oats), vegetables, fruits (chiefly figs and grapes for the table) and seeds, esparto grass, oils and vegetable extracts (chiefly olive oil), iron ore, zinc, natural phosphates, timber, cork, crin vegetal and tobacco.  The import of wool exceeds the export.  Sugar, coffee, machinery, metal work of all kinds, clothing and pottery are largely imported.  Of these by far the greater part comes from France.  The British imports consist chiefly of coal, cotton fabrics and machinery.

<h2>Exports</h2>

Algeria trades most extensively with France and Italy, in terms of both imports and exports, but also trades with the United States and Spain.

The People&apos;s Democratic Republic of Algeria (Arabic: الجمهورية الجزائرية الديمقراطية الشعبية) , or Algeria (Arabic: الجزائر), is a presidential state in north Africa, and the second largest country on the African continent, Sudan being the largest.  It is bordered by Tunisia in the northeast, Libya in the east, Niger in the southeast, Mali and Mauritania in the southwest, and Morocco as well as a few kilometers of its annexed territory, Western Sahara, in the west. Constitutionally, it is defined as  an Islamic, Arab, and Amazigh (Berber) country.  The name Algeria is derived from the name of the city of Algiers, from the Arabic word al-jaz  ir, which translates as the islands, referring to the four islands which lay off that city&apos;s coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525.

<h1> History </h1>
Main article: History of Algeria

Algeria has been inhabited by Berbers (or Amazigh) since at least 10,000 BC.  From 1000 BC on, the Carthaginians became an influence on them, establishing settlements along the coast. Berber kingdoms began to emerge, most notably Numidia, and seized the opportunity offered by the Punic Wars to become independent of Carthage, only to be taken over soon after by the Roman Republic in 200 BC.  As the western Roman Empire collapsed, the Berbers became independent again in much of the area, while the Vandals took over parts until later expelled by the generals of the Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I.  The Byzantine Empire then retained a precarious grip on the east of the country until the coming of the Arabs in the 8th century.

After some decades of fierce resistance under leaders such as Kusayla and Kahina, the Berbers adopted Islam en masse, but almost immediately expelled the Caliphate from Algeria, establishing an Ibadi state under the Rustamids.  Having converted the Kutama of Kabylie to its cause, the Shia Fatimids overthrew the Rustamids, and conquered Egypt.  They left Algeria and Tunisia to their Zirid vassals; when the latter rebelled and adopted Sunnism, they sent in a populous Arab tribe, the Banu Hilal, to weaken them, thus incidentally initiating the Arabization of the countryside.  The Almoravids and Almohads, Berber dynasties from the west founded by religious reformers, brought a period of relative peace and development; however, with the Almohads&apos; collapse, Algeria became a battleground for their three successor states, the Algerian Zayyanids, Tunisian Hafsids, and Moroccan Merinids.  In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Spain started attacking and taking over many coastal cities, prompting some to seek help from the Ottoman Empire.

Algeria was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Khair ad-Din and his  brother Aruj, who established Algeria&apos;s modern boundaries in the north and made its coast a base for the corsairs; their privateering peaked in Algiers in the 1600s. Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the First and Second Barbary War with the United States. On the pretext of a slight to their consul, the French invaded Algiers in 1830; however, intense resistance from such personalities as Emir Abdelkader made for a slow conquest of Algeria, not technically completed until the early 1900s when the last Tuareg were conquered.
Constantine, Algeria 1840

Meanwhile, however, the French had made Algeria an integral part of France, a status that would end only with the collapse of the Fourth Republic. Tens of thousands of settlers from France, Italy, Spain, and Malta moved in to farm the Algerian coastal plain and occupy the most prized parts of Algeria&apos;s cities, benefiting from the French government&apos;s confiscation of communally held land. People of European descent in Algeria (the so-called pieds-noirs), as well as the native Algerian Jews, were full French citizens starting from the end of the 19th century; by contrast, the vast majority of Muslim Algerians remained outside of French law, and possessed neither French citizenship nor the right to vote. Algeria&apos;s social fabric was stretched to breaking point during this period: literacy dropped massively, while land confiscation uprooted much of the population.

In 1954, the National Liberation Front (FLN) launched the guerrilla Algerian War of Independence; after nearly a decade of urban and rural warfare, they succeeded in pushing the French out in 1962. Most of the 1,025,000 pieds-noirs, as well as 91,000 harkis (pro-French Muslim Algerians serving in the French Army), together forming about 10% of the population of Algeria in 1962, fled Algeria for France in just a few months in the middle of that year.

Algeria&apos;s first president, the FLN leader Ahmed Ben Bella, was overthrown by his former ally and defense minister, Houari Boumédiènne in 1965. The country then enjoyed almost 25 years of relative stability under the one-party socialism of Boumedienne and his successors.

In December 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front won the first round of the country&apos;s first multiparty elections. The military then canceled the second round, forced then-president Chadli Bendjedid to resign, and banned the Islamic Salvation Front. The ensuing conflict engulfed Algeria in the violent Algerian Civil War.  More than 100,000 people were killed, often by unprovoked massacres and bombings of civilians by muslim guerrilla groups such as the Armed Islamic Group.

<h1> Politics </h1>
Main article: Politics of Algeria

The head of state is the President of the republic, who is elected to a 5-year term, renewable once. Algeria has universal suffrage. The President is the head of the Council of Ministers and of the High Security Council. He appoints the Prime Minister who is also the head of government. The Prime Minister appoints the Council of Ministers.

The Algerian parliament is bicameral, consisting of a lower chamber, the National People&apos;s Assembly (APN), with 380 members and an upper chamber, the Council of Nation, with 144 members. The APN is elected every 5 years.

Throughout the 1960&apos;s, Algeria supported many independence movements in sub-Saharan Africa, and was a leader in the Non-Aligned Movement. While it shares much of its history and cultural heritage with neighbouring Morocco, the two countries have had somewhat hostile relations with each other since Algeria&apos;s independence. This is due to two reasons: Morocco&apos;s claim to portions of eastern Algeria around Touat (which led to a brief war in 1963), and Algeria&apos;s support for the Polisario, a clandestine armed group seeking independence for the Moroccan-ruled Western Sahara, which it hosts within its borders in the city of Tindouf.  Tensions between Algeria and Morocco, as well as issues relating to the Algerian Civil War, have put great obstacles in the way of tightening the Maghreb Arab Union, nominally established in 1989 but with little practical weight, with its coastal neighbors.

<h1> Geography </h1>
Main article: Geography of Algeria

Map of Algeria with cities
Algeria

Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are few good harbours. The area just south of the coast, known as the Tell, is fertile. Further south is the Atlas mountain range and the Sahara desert. Algiers, Oran and Constantine are the main cities.

Algeria&apos;s climate is arid and hot, although the coastal climate is mild, and the winters in the mountainous areas can be severe. Algeria is prone to sirocco, a hot dust- and sand-laden wind especially common in summer.

<h1> Economy </h1>

Main article: Economy of Algeria

The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the second largest gas exporter; it ranks 14th in Petroleum reserves.

Algeria s financial and economic indicators improved during the mid-1990s, in part because of policy reforms supported by the IMF and debt rescheduling from the Paris Club. Algeria s finances in 2000 and 2001 benefited from an increase in oil prices and the government s tight fiscal policy, leading to a large increase in the trade surplus, record highs in foreign exchange reserves, and reduction in foreign debt. The government&apos;s continued efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector has had little success in reducing high unemployment and improving living standards. In 2001, the government signed an Association Treaty with the European Union that will eventually lower tariffs and increase trade.

<h1> Demographics </h1>
Main article: Demographics of Algeria

About 90% of the Algerians live in the northern, coastal area, although there are about 1.5 million people living in the southern desert most of them in oases. Ninty-nine percent of the population is classified as Arab-Berber, all of which are muslim; other religions are restricted to extremely small groups, mainly of foreigners. Europeans account for less than 1%.

note: almost all Algerians are Berber in origin, not Arab; the minority who identify themselves as Berber live mostly in the mountainous region of Kabylie east of Algiers; the Berbers are also Muslim but identify with their Berber rather than Arab cultural heritage.

<h1> Language </h1>
Main article: Languages of Algeria

The official language is Arabic, spoken natively in dialectal form (&quot;Darja&quot;) by some 80% of the population; the other 20% or so speak Berber, officially a national language. French is widely known from schools, but is very rare as a native language.

<h1> Culture </h1>

Main article: Culture of Algeria

Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country&apos;s recent history.  Famous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib and Kateb Yacine, while Assia Djebar is widely translated.  As early as Roman times, Apuleius, born in Mdaourouch, was native to what would become Algeria.

In philosophy and the humanities, Malek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization, while Augustine of Hippo was born in Annaba, and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria.

Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by Islam, the main religion.  The works of the Sanusi family in precolonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted.

The Algerian musical genre best known abroad is raï, a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as Khaled and Cheb Mami.  However, in Algeria itself the older, highly verbal chaabi style remains more popular, with such stars as El Hadj El Anka or Dahmane El Harrachi, while the tuneful melodies of Kabyle music, exemplified by Idir,Ait Menguellet or Salah Sadaoui, have a wide audience.  For more classical tastes, Andalusi music, brought from Al-Andalus by Morisco refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns.

Characters in Ayn Rand&apos;s novel, Atlas Shrugged.

Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

<h1>Balph Eubank</h1>
Called &quot;the literary leader of the age&quot;, despite the fact that he is incapable of writing anything that people actually want to read. What people want to read, he says, is irrelevant. He complains that it is disgraceful that artists are treated as peddlers, and that there should be a law limiting the sales of books to ten thousand copies. He is a member of the Looters. Balph Eubank appears in section 161.
<h1>Ben Nealy</h1>
A railroad contractor whom Dagny Taggart hires to replace the track on the Rio Norte Line with Rearden Metal. Nealy is incompetent, but Dagny can find no one better in all the country. Nealy believes that anything can get done with enough muscle power. He sees no role for intelligence in human achievement, and this is manifest in his inability to organize the project and to make decisions. He relies on Dagny and Ellis Wyatt to run things, and resents them for doing it, because it appears to him like they are just bossing people around. Ben Nealy appears in section 171.

<h1>Bertram Scudder</h1>
Editorial writer for the magazine The Future. He typically bashes business and businessmen, but he never says anything specific in his articles, relying on innuendo, sneers, and denunciation. He wrote a hatchet job on Hank Rearden called The Octopus. He is also vocal in support of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Bertram Scudder appears in section 161.

<h1>Betty Pope</h1>
A wealthy socialite who is having a meaningless sexual affair with James Taggart that coincides with the overall meaninglessness of her life. She regrets having to wake up every morning because she has to face another empty day. She is deliberately crude in a way that casts ridicule on her high social position. Betty Pope appears in sections 142 and 161.
<h1>Brakeman</h1>
An unnamed employee working on the Taggart Comet train. Dagny Taggart hears Brakeman whistling the theme of a concerto. When she asks him what piece it is from, he says it is Halley&apos;s Fifth Concerto. When Dagny points out that Richard Halley only wrote four concertos, Brakeman claims he made a mistake and he doesn&apos;t recall where he heard the piece.

Later, after Dagny instructs the train crew how to proceed, he asks a co-worker who she is, and learns she is the one who runs Taggart Transcontinental.

It is later discovered that the unknown brakeman is one of the strikers, when Dagny meets him in the valley. Brakeman appears in sections 112 and 113.

<h1>Cherryl Brooks</h1>
Dime store shopgirl who marries James Taggart after a chance encounter in her store the night the John Galt Line was deemed his greatest success.  She marries him thinking he is the heroic person behind Taggart Transcontinental. She is horrible to Dagny until the night before she commits suicide, when she confesses to Dagny that she married Jim, thinking she was marrying Dagny. Like Eddie Willers, Cherryl is one representation of a &quot;good&quot; person who lacks the extraordinary capacities of the primary heroes of the novel.

<h1>Claude Slagenhop</h1>
The president of political organization Friends of Global Progress (which is supported by Philip Rearden), and one of Lillian Rearden&apos;s friends. He believes that ideas are just air, that this is no time for talk, but for action. He is not bothered by the fact that action unguided by ideas is random and pointless. Global Progress is a sponsor of the Equalization of Opportunity Bill. Claude Slagenhop appears in section 161.
<h1>Cuffy Meigs</h1>
A Looter who&apos;s assigned by Wesley Mouch to keep watch over the workings of Taggart Transcontinental, and later assumes control over the company after Dagny Taggart leaves. He carries a pistol and wears a military uniform. The &quot;intellectual heir&quot; of Dr. Robert Stadler, Meigs comes to a fitting end at the hands of Project X.
<h1>Dagny Taggart</h1>
The main character in Atlas Shrugged (also the name of her namesake Mrs. Nathaniel Taggart). Dagny is Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental.  She is the female hero, the counterpart to John Galt, her journey is the journey of the reader exploring and understanding Galts philosophy. Those in the know know she is the one who really runs the railroad. In the course of the novel, she forms romantic liaisons with three men of ability. Dagny appears in sections 112, 113, 114, 132, 133, 141, 145, 146, 147, 148, 151, 152, and 161.

<h1>Dan Conway</h1>
The middle-aged president of the Phoenix-Durango railroad. Running a railroad is just about the only thing he knows. When the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is used to drive his business out of Colorado, he loses the will to fight, and resigns himself to a quiet life of books and fishing. He claims that somebody had to be sacrificed, it turned out to be him, and he has no right to complain, bowing to the will of the majority. When pressed he says he doesn&apos;t really believe this is right, but he can&apos;t understand why it is wrong and what the alternative might be. He is trapped by a moral code that makes him a willing victim, and rather than challenge that morality, he simply gives up. Dan Conway appears in sections 145 and 146, and is mentioned in section 148.
<h1>Dick McNamara</h1>
A contractor who finished the San Sebastian Line and who is hired to lay the new Rearden Metal track for the Rio Norte Line. Before he gets a chance to do so, he mysteriously disappears. Dick McNamara is mentioned in sections 133 and 141.
<h1>Eddie Willers</h1>
Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operation at Taggart Transcontinental. He grew up with Dagny Taggart. His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts, and he followed in their footsteps. He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental. He is also secretly in love with Dagny. Willers is generally assumed to represent the common man: someone who does not possess the promethian creative ability of The Strikers, but nevertheless matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations. Eddie Willers appears in sections 111, 114, 117, 132, 133, 141, 151, and 152.

<h1>Ellis Wyatt</h1>
The head of Wyatt Oil. He has almost single-handedly revived the economy of Colorado by discovering oil there. Of all the disappearances of industrialists in the novel, Wyatt&apos;s, involving the fiery destruction of his oil wells, is surely the most dramatic. Ellis Wyatt is mentioned or appears in sections 111, 114, 132, 146, 147, 148, and 152.

<h1>Francisco d&apos;Anconia</h1>
One of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged. By all accounts, he is a worthless millionaire playboy, owner by inheritance of the world&apos;s largest copper mining empire, the man behind the San Sebastian Mines, and a childhood friend and first love of Dagny Taggart.

Francisco began working on the sly as a teenager in order to learn all he could about business. While still a student at Patrick Henry University, he began working at a copper foundry, and investing in the stock market. By the time he was twenty he had made enough to purchase the foundry. He began working for d&apos;Anconia Copper as assistant superintendent of a mine in Montana, but was quickly promoted to head of the New York office. He took over d&apos;Anconia Copper at age 23, after the death of his father.

When he was 26, Francisco secretly joined the Strikers and began to slowly destroy the d&apos;Anconia empire so the Looters could not get it. He adopted the persona of a worthless playboy, by which he is known to the world, as an effective cover.

His full name is Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d&apos;Anconia.

According to  Adam Reed ( Who is Francisco D&apos;Anconia?), d&apos;Anconia is the only Hero-class character who is recognizably Jewish (not in the religious, but in the historical sense, like Ayn Rand herself). Francisco D&apos;Anconia appears or is mentioned in sections 132, 141, 144, 151, and 152 - this last section includes a detailed history of his life.
<h1>Hank Rearden</h1>
One of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged. He is the founder of Rearden Steel and the inventor of Rearden Metal. He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian, his brother Philip, and an elderly woman known only as Rearden&apos;s Mother, all of whom he supports. Gwen Ives is his secretary.

The character of Hank Rearden has two important roles to play in the novel. First, he is in the same position as the reader in that he is aware that there is something wrong with the world but is not sure what it is. Rearden is guided toward an understanding of the solution through his friendship with Francisco d&apos;Anconia, who does know the secret, and by this mechanism the reader is also prepared to understand the secret when it is revealed explicitly in Galt&apos;s Speech.

Second, Rearden is used to illustrate Rand&apos;s theory of sex. Lillian Rearden cannot appreciate Hank Rearden&apos;s virtues, and she is portrayed as being disgusted by sex. Dagny Taggart clearly does appreciate Rearden&apos;s virtues, and this appreciation evolves into a sexual desire. Rearden is torn by a contradiction because he accepts the premises of the traditional view of sex as a lower instinct, while responding sexually to Dagny, who represents his highest values. Rearden struggles to resolve this internal conflict and in doing so illustrates Rand&apos;s sexual theory. Rearden appears in sections 121, 132, 147, and 161, and is mentioned in sections 114 and 131.

<h1>Hugh Akston</h1>
Identified as &quot;One of the last great advocates of reason.&quot; He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University, where he taught Francisco d&apos;Anconia, John Galt, and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He was, along with Robert Stadler, a father figure to these three. Akston&apos;s name is so hallowed that a young lady, on hearing that Francisco had studied under him, is shocked. She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century. Hugh Akston is mentioned in section 161.
<h1>James Taggart</h1>
The President of Taggart Transcontinental and a leader of the Looters. Taggart is an expert influence peddler who is incapable of making decisions on his own. He relies on his sister Dagny Taggart to actually run the railroad, but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor.

As the novel progresses, the moral philosophy of the Looters is revealed: it is a code of nihilism. The goal of this code is to not exist, to become a zero. Taggart struggles to remain unaware that this is his goal. He maintains his pretence that he wants to live, and becomes horrified whenever his mind starts to grasp the truth about himself. This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life: the desire to destroy those on whom his life depends, and the horror that he will succeed at this. James Taggart appears in sections 111, 114, 131, 132, 143, 144, 152 and 161, and is mentioned in sections 146 and 148.
<h1>John Galt</h1>
*The question &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot; is asked repeatedly throughout Atlas Shrugged. Late into the book we learn that John Galt is the man who stopped the motor of the world and the leader of the Strikers. He is also the same character as the Mystery Worker.

The son of an Ohio garage mechanic, Galt left home at age 12 and began college at Patrick Henry University at age 16. There he befriended Francisco d&apos;Anconia and Ragnar Danneskjöld, all three of whom double-majored in physics and philosophy. They were the cherished students of the brillant scientist Robert Stadler and the brillant philsopher Hugh Akston.

After graduating, Galt became an engineer at the Twentieth Century Motor Works where he designed a revolutionary new motor powered by ambient static electricity with the potential to change the world. Like Ellis Wyatt, he has created what many had for years said was impossible. When the company owners decided to run the factory by the collectivist maxim, &apos;By each according to his ability, to each according to his need&apos;, Galt organized a successful labor strike, proclaiming his promise to halt the world.  He began traversing the globe, meeting the world&apos;s most successful businessmen, systematically convincing them to follow in his footsteps; one by one, they began abandoning their business empires (which, Galt convinced them, were doomed to failure anyhow, given the increased nationalization of industry by the government).

Secretly, these captains of industry, led by Galt and banker Midas Mulligan, had created their own society   a secret enclave of rational individualists living in &quot;Galt&apos;s Gulch&quot;, a town secluded high in a wilderness of mountains.  Dagny accidentally finds the town   and a shocked John Galt   by crash-landing a light aircraft while pursuing Quentin Daniels.

Since everyone across the country is repeating the phrase, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is natural that many people have attempted to answer that question. The phrase becomes an expression of helplessness and despair at the current state of the world. Dagny Taggart hears a number of John Galt Legends before finding the real John Galt and eventually joining his cause, and learning that all of the stories have an element of truth to them.

:There is a clothing store in Vail, Colorado called John Galt Ltd. One presumes that, on occasion, a customer unknowingly walks in and asks, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;

<h1>Lillian Rearden</h1>
The wildly unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden. They have been married eight years as the novel begins.

Lillian is a Moocher who seeks to destroy her husband. She compares being Rearden&apos;s wife with owning the world&apos;s most powerful horse. Since she cannot comfortably ride a horse that goes too fast, she must bridle it down to her level, even if that means it will never reach its full potential and its power will be greviously wasted.

Lillian also serves to illustrate Rand&apos;s Theory of sex. She believes sex is a base animal instinct and that sexual indulgence is a sign of moral weakness. She is incapable of feeling this kind of desire, which she believes testifies to her moral superiority. However, according to the theory of sex Lillian&apos;s lack of sexual capacity results from her inability to experience value in herself; she is therefore unable to respond sexually when she experiences value in others.

Lillian tolerates sex with her husband only because she is &apos;realistic&apos; enough to know he is just a brute who requires satisfaction of his brute instincts. In section 161 she indicates that she abhors Francisco d&apos;Anconia, because she believes he is a sexual adventurer. Lillian Rearden appears in sections 121 and 161.

<h1>The Looters</h1>
A group of evil characters sometimes referred to as &quot;James Taggart and his friends&quot;. They are similar to the Moochers. The Looters consist of men and women who use force to obtain value from those who produce it. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Looters include: Mr. Thompson, Balph Eubank, Floyd Ferris, James Taggart, Orren Boyle, Paul Larkin, Robert Stadler, Simon Pritchett, Wesley Mouch, and Cuffy Miegs. 
<h1>Midas Mulligan</h1>
A wealthy banker who mysteriously disappears in protest after he is given a court order to loan money to an incompetent loan applicant. Midas Mulligan is responsible for the creation and distribution of the money that is exclusively used in Galt&apos;s Gulch, and is the original owner of the land where Galt&apos;s Gulch is located. He is also responsible for the production of the money used there.
<h1>The Moochers</h1>
A group of characters, similar to the Looters, who use guilt as a weapon against those who produce value. They seek to destroy the producers despite the fact that they are dependent upon them. The Moochers include Lillian Rearden, Philip Rearden, and Hank Rearden&apos;s mother. It has been suggested that the term &quot;mooch&quot; received its beginning in this novel and is actually intended to be spelled &quot;mouch,&quot; referring to infamous character of Wesley Mouch.

<h1>Mort Liddy</h1>
A hack composer who writes trite scores for movies and modern symphonies that no one listens to. He believes melody is a primitive vulgarity. He is one of Lillian Rearden&apos;s friends and a member of the cultural elite. Mort Liddy appears in section 161.

<h1>Mr. Mowen</h1>
The president of the Amalgamated Switch and Signal Company, Inc. of Connecticut. He is a businessman who sees nothing wrong with the moral code that is destroying society and would never dream of saying he is in business for any reason other than the good of society. He is unable to grapple with abstract issues, and is frightened of anything controversial. Dagny Taggart hires Mr. Mowen to produce switches made of Rearden Metal. He is reluctant to build anything with this unproven technology, and has to be ridden and cajoled before he is willing to accept the contract.  When pressured by public opinion, he discontinues production of the switches, forcing Dagny to find an alternative source. Mr. Mowen appears in section 171.

<h1>Mystery Worker</h1>
A menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employee&apos;s cafeteria. Eddie finds him very easy to talk to, and Mystery Worker not-so-subtly leads him on so that Eddie reveals important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental. Eddie tells him which suppliers and contractors Dagny is most dependent on, and with remarkable consistency, those are the next men to mysteriously disappear. Mystery Worker is actually John Galt. Mystery Worker appears in section 133.

<h1>The unnamed newsstand owner</h1>
He works in the Taggart Terminal. Twenty years ago he owned a cigarette factory but it went under, and he&apos;s been working at his newsstand ever since. He is a collector of cigarettes, and knows every brand ever made. He occasionally chats with Dagny Taggart when she comes by. On one occasion, in section section 132, after Dagny asks him about his collection, he bemoans the fact that there are no new brands and the old brands are all disappearing. He examines a cigarette given to Dagny by Hugh Akston, but it is a new brand that he has never seen before. It carries the sign of the dollar. In his first appearance, the Newsstand Owner likens the fire of a cigarette to the fire of the mind. This alludes to the Greek myth of Prometheus, who gave mankind the gift of fire, allowing it to raise itself up and become civilized. In Atlas Shrugged, it is the mind of man that raises mankind. Thus the cigarettes become symbolic of the men of the mind. The disappearance of the old brands represents the disappearance of the men of the mind, and the Newsstand Owner&apos;s discovery of the new brand foreshadows Dagny&apos;s discovery of a new kind of men of the mind.

<h1>Orren Boyle</h1>
The head of Associated Steel and a friend of James Taggart. He is one of the Looters. He is an investor in the San Sebastian Mines. Orren Boyle appears or is mentioned in sections 111, 114, 131, 132, 144, and 152.
<h1>Owen Kellogg</h1>
Assistant to the Manager of the Taggart Terminal in New York. He catches Dagny Taggart&apos;s eye as one of the few competent men on staff. After seeing the sorry state of the Ohio Division she decides to make him to its new Superintendent. However, as soon as she returns to New York, Kellogg informs her that he is quiting his job. He admits that he loves his work, but that&apos;s not enough to keep him. He won&apos;t say why he is leaving or what he will do. Later, he is noticed working as transient labor by the unsuccessful/unmotivated businessman Mr. Mowen. Owen Kellog eventually reaches, and settles in Atlantis. Owen Kellogg appears in sections 112 and 114.

<h1>Paul Larkin</h1>
An unsuccessful, middle-aged businessman, a friend of the Rearden family, and a member of the Looters. In section 121 Larkin visits Philadelphia to warn Hank Rearden of possible trouble from Washington. In section 131 he meets with the other Looters to work out a plan to bring Rearden down. James Taggart knows he is friends with Hank Rearden and challenges his loyalty, and Larkin assures Taggart that he will go along with them. Paul Larkin appears in sections 121 and 132.
<h1>Philip Rearden</h1>
The younger brother of Hank Rearden, and a Moocher. He lives in his brother&apos;s home in Philadelphia and is completely dependent on him. He believes that the source of his sustenance is evil and would love to see him destroyed. He has never had a career and spends his time perfunctorily working for various social groups.
He becomes resentful of his brother&apos;s charity. He then requests that he be granted a job from his brother because he should not have to be burdened by the feeling of inadequacy of not earning his own livelihood. When confronted by his brother on how this job would be a mutually beneficial arrangement, Philip shrugs the argument off as irrelevant and that the job should be entitled to him solely based on his need for money and the fact of familial ties. Philip Rearden appears in sections 121 and 161.

<h1>Quentin Daniels</h1>
An enterprising engineer hired by Dagny Taggart to reconstruct John Galt&apos;s motor.  Partway through this process, Quentin withdraws his effort for the same reasons John Galt himself had.  Dagny sets out to meet Quentin in hopes of convincing him to resume his work.  John Galt narrowly gets to him first.  Dagny&apos;s pursuit of Quentin leads her to &quot;Galt&apos;s Gulch&quot;

<h1>Ragnar Danneskjöld</h1>
One of the original Strikers. He is now world famous as a pirate. Ragnar was from Norway, the son of a bishop and the scion of one of Norway&apos;s most ancient, noble families. He attended Patrick Henry University and became friends with John Galt and Francisco d&apos;Anconia, while studying under Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler.

Ragnar seizes relief ships that are being sent from the United States to Europe. No one knows what he does with the goods he seizes. As the novel progresses, Ragnar begins, for the first time, to become active in American waters, and is even spotted in Delaware Bay. Reportedly, his ship is better than any available in the fleets of the world&apos;s navies.

When he became a pirate, he was disowned and excommunicated. There is a price on his head in Norway, Portugal, Turkey.

According to Ayn Rand (verbal report), his name is a tribute to Victor Hugo.  In Hugo&apos;s first novel, Italic textHans of IcelandItalic text, the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld.  His name may be a pun on &apos;Dane&apos;s Gold&apos;, although &quot;skjöld&quot; means shield, not gold. Ragnar Danneskjöld appears in section 161.

<h1>Rearden&apos;s mother</h1>
Unnamed in Atlas Shrugged, she is a Moocher who lives with her son Hank Rearden at his home in Philadelphia. She is involved in church-based charity work, and berates Rearden whenever she can. She insults him by saying he was always selfish, even as a child. She dotes on her weak son Philip Rearden. Rearden&apos;s mother appears in section 121.
<h1>Richard Halley</h1>
Dagny Taggart&apos;s favorite composer, who mysteriously disappeared after the evening of his greatest triumph. In section 141 we learn that Richard Halley spent years as a struggling and unappreciated composer. At age 24 his opera Phaethon was performed for the first time, to an audience who booed and heckled it. (It was based on the Greek myth in which Phaethon steals his father&apos;s chariot, and dies in an audacious attempt to drive the sun across the sky. Halley changed the story, though, into one of triumph, in which Phaethon succeeds.) For years Halley wrote in obscurity. After nineteen years, Phaethon was performed again, but this time it was received to the greatest ovation the opera house had ever heard. It appears his critics felt he had paid his dues long enough that he was at last worthy of their approval. The following day, Halley retired, sold the rights to his music, and disappeared. Richard Halley is mentioned in sections 112, 114, 133, and 141, and appears in section 152.
<h1>Dr. Robert Stadler</h1>
A former professor at Patrick Henry University, mentor to Francisco d&apos;Anconia, John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld. He has since become a sell-out, one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval, to the detriment of the free. He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military, including the instrument of his demise: Project X.
<h1>Dr. Simon Pritchett</h1>
The prestigious head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University and is considered the leading philosopher of the age. He is also a Looter. He is certainly representative of the philosophy of the age - he is a crude reductionist who believes man is nothing but a collection of chemicals; he believes there are no standards, that definitions are fluid, reason is a superstition, that it is futile to seek meaning in life, and that the duty of a philosopher is to show that nothing can be understood. He explains all this in his book The Metaphysical Contradictions of the Universe, and at cocktail parties. Dr. Pritchett appears in section 161.
<h1>The Strikers</h1>
People of the mind who go on strike because they do not appreciate being exploited by the Looters and demonized by a society who depends on them for its very existence. The leader of the Strikers is John Galt. Other Strikers include: Hugh Akston, Francisco d&apos;Anconia, Ragnar Danneskjöld, Richard Halley, and the Brakeman. Characters who join the Strikers in the course of the book include: Dagny Taggart, Ellis Wyatt, Hank Rearden, Dick McNamara, and Owen Kellogg.
<h1>Mr. Thompson</h1>
The &quot;Head of the State,&quot; which essentially means that he&apos;s the President of the United States, though he&apos;s never specifically referred to as such. In the world of Atlas Shrugged all Presidents and Prime Ministers are refered to simply as &quot;Head of the State&quot; and &quot;Mr. ____.&quot; This is because countries have been standardized as &quot;People&apos;s States&quot; which seem to share a common form of government. Thomspon&apos;s title can thus be seen as reflecting the fact that the US is in the process of evolving into one of these &quot;People&apos;s States.&quot; One of the Looters, he&apos;s not particularly intelligent and has a very undistinguished look. He knows politics, however, and is a master of public relations and back-room deals. Rand&apos;s notes indicate that she modelled him on President Harry S. Truman.

<h1>Wesley Mouch</h1>
A member of the Looters and, at the beginning of the storyline, the incompetent lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington. Initially Wesley Mouch is the least powerful and least significant of the Looters - the other members of this group feel they can look down upon him with impunity. Eventually he becomes the most powerful Looter, and the country&apos;s economic dictator, thereby illustrating Rand&apos;s belief that a government-run economy places too much power in the hands of incompetent bureaucrats who would never have positions of similar influence in a private sector business. Wesley Mouch appears in section 131 and is mentioned in section 161.

Technology in Atlas Shrugged, Ayn Rand&apos;s novel includes a variety of technological products and devices.  In addition to real world technology (aircraft, automobiles, diesel engines, phonograph records, radios, telephones, television, and traffic signals) Atlas Shrugged also includes various fictional technologies or fictional variants on real inventions.

Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

<h1>Fictional technology</h1>
Fictional inventions mentioned in the book include refractor rays (Gulch mirage), Rearden Metal, a sonic death ray (&quot;Project X&quot;), voice activated door locks (Gulch power station), motors powered by static electricity, palm-activated door locks (Galt&apos;s NY lab), shale-oil drilling, and a nerve-induction torture machine.

<h2>Traffic Signals</h2>
Early on, the book mentions the &quot;screech&quot; of a traffic signal as it changes. This implies the older technology of mechanical traffic signals, the kind which displayed a pennant or flag indicating stop or go, and the inverse indicator in the opposite direction. Traffic signals using lights have been around for over 40 years, so anything of this type is very old compared to today.

<h2>Project X</h2>
Project X is an invention of the scientists at the state science institute, requiring tons of Rearden Metal. Basically, it is a &quot;death ray&quot;, and is capable of destroying anything. The scientists claim that the project will be used to preserve peace and squash rebellion. It is destroyed towards the end of the book, and emits a pulse of radiation that destroys everything in the surrounding area, including Cuffy Meigs and Dr. Stadler, as well as the Taggart Bridge.

<h2>Rearden Metal</h2>
Rearden metal is a fictitious metal alloy invented by Hank Rearden.  It is lighter than traditional steel but stronger, and is to steel what steel was to iron.  It is described as greenish-blue.  Among its ingredients are iron and copper.

Initially no one is willing to use Rearden metal because no one wants to stick his neck out and be the first to try it.  Finally, Dagny Taggart places an order for Rearden Metal when she needs rails to rebuild the dying Rio Norte Line.

The first thing made from Rearden metal is a bracelet.

Rearden metal is mentioned in sections 114, 121, 131, 148 and 161.

The success of Wyatt Oil that followed this discovery suddenly and unexpectedly turned Colorado into the leading economy in the country.

Wyatt Oil traditionally relied on Taggart Transcontinental&apos;s Rio Norte Line to ship its oil.  But when that company could not grow fast enough to keep up with the booming Colorado economy, Wyatt started using the small but well-managed Phoenix-Durango instead.  This prompted James Taggart to make deals with his friends to drive the Phoenix-Durango out of Colorado.  Afterwards, Dagny Taggart has to rebuild the Rio Norte Line so it can supply transportation to Wyatt Oil - if she fails, the economy of Colorado, and of the whole country, could collapse.

Wyatt Oil is mentioned in sections 111, 132 and 171.

Some of the important concepts discussed in Atlas Shrugged include  the Sanction of the Victim and the Theory of Sex.

<h2>Sanction of the Victim</h2>

The Sanction of the Victim is defined as &quot;the willingness of the good to suffer at the hands of the evil, to accept the role of sacrificial victim for the &apos;sin&apos; of creating values.&quot;

The entire story of Atlas Shrugged can be seen as an answer to the question, what would happen if this sanction was revoked?  When Atlas shrugs, relieving himself of the burden of carrying the world, he is revoking his sanction.

The concept is apparently original in the thinking of Ayn Rand and is foundational to her moral theory.  She holds that evil is a parasite on the good and can only exist if the good tolerates it.  To quote from Galt&apos;s Speech: &quot;Evil is impotent and has no power but that which we let it extort from us&quot;, and, &quot;I saw that evil was impotent...and the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it.&quot;  Morality requires that we do not sanction our own victimhood.

Throughout Atlas Shrugged, numerous characters admit that there is something wrong with the world but they cannot put their finger on what it is.  The concept they cannot grasp is the sanction of the victim.  The first person to grasp the concept is John Galt, who vows to stop the motor of the world by getting the creators of the world to withhold their sanction.

We first glimpse the concept in section 121 when Hank Rearden feels he is duty-bound to support his family, despite their hostility towards him.

In section 146 the principle is stated explicitly by Dan Conway: &quot;I suppose somebody&apos;s got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain.&quot;

<h2>Theory of Sex</h2>

In rejecting the traditional Christian altruist moral code, Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a logical implication of altruism.

Rand introduces a theory of sex in Atlas Shrugged which is purportedly implied by her broader ethical and psychological theories.  Far from being a debasing animal instinct, sex is the highest celebration of our greatest values.  Sex is a physical response to intellectual and spiritual values a mechanism for giving concrete expression to values that could otherwise only be experienced in the abstract.

One is sexually attracted to those who embody one&apos;s values.  Those who have base values will be attracted to baseness, to those who also have ignoble values.  Those who lack any clear purpose will find sex devoid of meaning.  People of high values will respond sexually to those who embody high values.

That our sexual desire is a response to the embodiment of our values in others is a radical and original theory.  However, even those who are sympathetic to this theory have criticized it as being incomplete.  For instance, since according to Rand the economy is also such an expression of values, and since it is always possible to encounter someone who embodies one&apos;s values more completely, this would seem to make family undesirable. (Indeed, Rand treats &quot;family&quot; as a sort of trap.) Furthermore, promiscuity, prostitution, and an endless round-robin of &quot;values-driven&quot; sexual relationships would become inevitable.  From this viewpoint, one could say that Aldous Huxley portrayed the ideal sexual state: Brave New World features humans who are incapable of deviating from their caste-oriented &quot;values&quot;, which naturally include a code of sexual desirability.

Her sexual theory is illustrated in the contrasting relationships of Hank Rearden with Lillian Rearden and Dagny Taggart, and later with Dagny Taggart and John Galt.

Other important illustrations of this theory are found in:

Section 152 - recounts Dagny&apos;s relationship with Francisco d&apos;Anconia.

Section 161 - recounts Hank and Lillian Rearden&apos;s courtship, and Lillian&apos;s attitude towards sex.

This is a list of general items in Ayn Rand&apos;s Atlas Shrugged.

Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

<h1>Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule</h1>

The Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule is passed by the National Alliance of Railroads in section 145, allegedly to prevent &quot;destructive competition&quot; between railroads.  The rule gives the Alliance the authority to forbid competition between railroads in certain parts of the country.  It was crafted by Orren Boyle as a favor for James Taggart, with the purpose of driving the Phoenix-Durango out of Colorado.

<h1>Bracelet</h1>

The very first thing made from Rearden Metal is a bracelet.  The bracelet is used to illustrate Rand&apos;s Theory of Sex.

The bracelet symbolizes the value created by Hank Rearden&apos;s long struggle to invent Rearden Metal.  When he gives it to Lillian Rearden as a present in section 121; she says, &quot;It&apos;s fully as valuable as a piece of railroad rails.&quot;  However, Lillian fully grasps the significance of the gift; her snide remark is her way of denigrating her husband&apos;s ethos.

In section 161, Lillian wears this bracelet at a party thrown on her anniversary.  She makes fun of it all night long, and when Dagny Taggart hears Lillian say she would gladly trade it for a common diamond bracelet, Dagny takes her up on it.

Lillian later asks for it back upon realizing her power over her husband was slowly diminishing.  Dagny denies the offer.

The bracelet appears in sections 121 and 161.

<h1>Cub Club</h1>

A night club in New York.  When Francisco d&apos;Anconia returns to New York in section 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the Cub Club and the liverwurst at Moe&apos;s Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

<h1>Equalization of Opportunity Bill</h1>

A bill designed by the Looters that proposes to limit the number of businesses any one person can own to one.  It is aimed primarily at Hank Rearden, who uses Rearden Ore to guarantee Rearden Steel with a supply of iron ore.  By passing this Bill, the Looters can seize Rearden&apos;s other businesses for themselves, and then deny him the iron he needs to run his steel mills.

The Looters claim the Bill is meant to give a chance to the little guy.

The Equalization of Opportunity Bill is appears in section 161.

<h1>Galt&apos;s Gulch</h1>

A secluded refuge in a valley of Colorado where the men of ability have retreated after relinquishing participation in American society.  Nicknamed &quot;Galt&apos;s Gulch&quot; by its inhabitants, it is in fact the property of &quot;Midas&quot; Mulligan, one of the early strikers to follow John Galt&apos;s call. This call was to the great men of mind and action to abandon the increasingly slave-state inclinations of a decaying United States - to go on strike - thereby withdrawing the only thing supporting the parasites and looters.

Sarcastically nicknamed Midas in the press because everything he seemed to touch turned to gold, Mulligan adopted the nickname during his explosive investment career before dropping out of sight.  He had purchased this land among his far-ranging speculative endeavors, and subsequently retreated to it upon his disappearance.  Other strikers soon followed him there, including John Galt, renting or buying land for summer retreats as a respite from continuing their search for fellow strikers among the increasingly collapsing American society.  Eventually, a society develops in Galt&apos;s Gulch as more people live there year-round as the outside world becomes virtually unsafe to visit.

We are introduced to Galt&apos;s Gulch in the final section of the Novel, in the first chapter, entitled Atlantis.  The people live with each other in completely free society and embody everything which is the thesis of the Novel, the appropriate values for a society of Mankind: philosophical, moral, economic, legal, aesthetic, and sexual, among others too numerous to mention.

We find industrious, ambitious, happy people continuing their chosen fields of endeavor without the yokes of any taxation or regulation.  Conversely, there is a reverence for private property; everything transacted is paid for with the re-invented currency of solid gold coin struck from the reserves of Midas Mulligan&apos;s bank which now resides in the valley.  The townspeople receive services from the various heroes we have met throughout the Novel, who all now reside and produce in the valley. They purchase power inexpensively from Galt and his invention of the static electricity motor, maintain their anonymity from the outside world via Galt&apos;s invention of the air-wave reflection device (giving the view from above the camouflage of reflected images of other mountainsides nearby), and some attend Galt&apos;s lectures on Physics, where he explains his discoveries on new fundamental laws and applied mathematics.  The people purchase medical treatment from the care of Dr. Hendricks, who uses his invention of a portable X-ray machine to initially diagnose Dagny Taggart upon her crash landing into the valley, attend concerts of new musical compositions of Richard Halley who has continued to compose in the Valley, acquire raw materials from the efforts of Francisco D&apos;Anconia&apos;s excavations around the valley, attend philosophy lectures from the now-retired pirate Ragnar Danneskjöld, receive loans from Midas Mulligan, etc.

Rand&apos;s description of Galt&apos;s Gulch was inspired by a visit she and her husband Frank O&apos;Connor took to Ouray, Colorado while researching Colorado for the novel.

<h1>Halley&apos;s Fifth Concerto</h1>

Richard Halley disappeared after he had written only four concertos.  In section 112, Dagny Taggart, an enthusiastic fan of Halley&apos;s music, hears an unfamiliar theme being whistled by a brakeman on the Taggart Comet.  She asks him what it is; he responds Halley&apos;s Fifth Concerto.  When Dagny says Halley only wrote four concertos, the brakeman says he made a mistake and denies knowing what the song was.

Later, Dagny calls Mr. Ayers to find out if Halley wrote a fifth concerto. Ayers says Halley did not.

Halley&apos;s Fifth Concerto is mentioned in sections 112, 114 and 152.

<h1>Halley&apos;s Fourth Concerto</h1>

The last thing Richard Halley wrote before he disappeared.  It is a song of rebellion and defiance that seemed to say agony and suffering were not necessary.  Dagny Taggart listened to this song in section 141.

It is mentioned in section 152.

<h1>Heaven&apos;s In Your Backyard</h1>

A film.  Mort Liddy wrote the score, using a bastardized version of Halley&apos;s Fourth Concerto.  It is mentioned in section 161.

<h1>John Galt Legends</h1>

Since everyone across the country is asking, &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, it is not surprising that some people have come up with answers.  A number of John Galt Legends are told, each of which, ironically, turns out to be true, at least symbolically.

Legend 1 (section 161):  A spinster at Lillian Rearden&apos;s party tells Dagny the story.  John Galt was a man of inestimable wealth who found the sunken island of Atlantis while fighting the worst storm ever wreaked upon the world.  The site was so beautiful that, having seen it, he could never go back to the world, so he sank his ship and took his fortune down with him.

The actual John Galt was a man who created something of inestimable value, a new motor, and who discovered the secret to what was wrong with the world while fighting the most evil social philosophy ever put into practice.  The world he envisioned was so beautiful that he refused to live in the world that was, and disappeared, taking the secret of motor with him.

Atlantis, the Isles of the Blessed, is a place where no one could enter except those who had the spirit of a hero.  Described in these terms, it is the same as Galt&apos;s Gulch.

<h1>Moe&apos;s Delicatessen</h1>

A delicatessen in New York.  When Francisco d&apos;Anconia returns to New York in section 141, he explains he came because of a hat-check girl at the Cub Club and the liverwurst at Moe&apos;s Delicatessen on Third Avenue.

<h1>National Alliance of Railroads</h1>

An industry group formed to promote the welfare of the industry as a whole, requiring members to sacrifice their individual interests for the common good.  Orren Boyle has friends on the National Alliance of Railroads, and he gets them to support the Anti-dog-eat-dog Rule, which uses a string of pretenses to drive the Phoenix-Durango out of Colorado.

The National Alliance of Railroads is mentioned in sections 131, 145 and 146.

<h1>National Council of Metal Industries</h1>

An industry group that uses political pull to get its way. James Taggart has friends on the National Council of Metal Industries, and he gets them to support legislation that will hurt Rearden Steel and help Associated Steel.

The National Council of Metal Industries is mentioned in section 131.

<h1>Patrick Henry University</h1>

The most prestigious university in the world.  It was attended by John Galt, Francisco d&apos;Anconia, and Ragnar Danneskjold, where they met and became friends.  Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler taught there.  It is located in Cleveland.

<h1>Rio Norte Line</h1>

A branch of Taggart Transcontinental that runs from Cheyenne, Wyoming to El Paso, Texas.

It is mentioned in sections 111, 114, 131 (alluded to), 132, 133, 141, 146, 147 and 148.

<h1>Rockdale Station</h1>

A station on the Taggart Transcontinental line, located five miles from the Taggart estate and overlooking the Hudson River.  It was the site of Dagny Taggart&apos;s first job with the railroad, night operator, at age 16.

It appears in section 152.

<h1>San Sebastian</h1>

A community built to house the workers of the San Sebastian Mines and their families.  As it turns out, the houses, roads, and everything of practical value is built so poorly that the community can be expected to fall apart within a year or two.  Only the church was built to last.

It is mentioned in section 152.

<h1>San Sebastian Line</h1>

A branch of Taggart Transcontinental that serves the San Sebastian Mines in Mexico.

The mines were developed by Francisco d&apos;Anconia and attracted significant investments from James Taggart and Orren Boyle, who assumed Francisco could be counted on to deliver a winner.

The San Sebastian Line is nationalized by the Mexican government soon after completion.

When it is nationalized in section 142, it is referred to as the San Sebastian Railroad.

It is mentioned in sections 114, 131, 132, 133, 142, 143 and 152.

<h1>San Sebastian Mines</h1>

San Sebastian Mines is a copper mining project in Mexico founded by Francisco d&apos;Anconia and named after his ancestor Sebastian d&apos;Anconia.  Francisco&apos;s reputation as a businessman is so great that investors flock to him, begging to invest money in the enterprise.  Investors include James Taggart and Orren Boyle. Taggart goes so far as to build a new branch of Taggart Transcontinental, the San Sebastian Line, to serve the mines, sinking $30 million into the project.  When the development of the mines appears complete, the Mexican government nationalizes them as well as the San Sebastian Line, only to discover there is no copper and there never was.

When Taggart tells Francisco he considers the Mines a rotten swindle (section 161), Francisco explains that Taggart should be pleased with the way he ran the mines.  He says he put into practice those moral precepts that were accepted around the world.  The world says it is evil to pursue a profit   he got no profit from the worthless mines.  The world says the purpose of an enterprise is not to produce, but to give a livelihood to its employees   it produced nothing, but created jobs that would never have existed if one was only concerned with developing a real mine.  The world says the owner is an exploiter and the workers do all the real work   he left the enterprise entirely in the hands of the workers and did not burden anyone with his presence.  The world says need is more important than ability   he hired a mining specialist who needed a job very badly, but had no ability.

In short, the San Sebastian Mines were an illustration of what happens when this moral code is put into practice, and a warning of what will soon happen to the world as a whole.

The San Sebastian Mines appear in sections 111, 131, 132, 142, 151, 152 and 161.

<h1>Taggart Building</h1>

A skyscraper in New York, the headquarters of Taggart Transcontinental, and the location of the Taggart Terminal.

<h1>Taggart Comet</h1>

The Taggart Comet is Taggart Transcontinental&apos;s flagship train.  It runs from New York to San Francisco, and has never been late.

The Taggart Comet appears in sections 112, 113 and 152.

<h1>The Future</h1>

See Bertram Scudder.

<h1>The Heart Is A Milkman</h1>

The Heart is a Milkman is a novel being written by Balph Eubank.  It is about the central fact of human existence, frustration.  Eubank says he will dedicate it to Lillian Rearden.

It is mentioned in section 161.

<h1>The Octopus</h1>

See Bertram Scudder.

<h1>The Vulture Is Molting</h1>

A best-selling novel that captures the spirit of the times, The Vulture Is Molting is &quot;A penetrating study of a businessman&apos;s greed.  A fearless revelation of man&apos;s depravity.&quot;  The book is mentioned in section 141 as one of the artifacts of popular culture that depresses Dagny Taggart with its baseness.

<h1>Wayne-Falkland Hotel</h1>

A luxurious hotel in New York, it is considered the best hotel left in the world.  It is where Francisco d&apos;Anconia stays when he is in town.  It was also the scene of Dagny Taggart&apos;s debut ball when she was seventeen.

The Wayne-Falkland Hotel is mentioned in sections 141, 151 and 152.

<h1>Wyatt Oil Fields</h1>

The Wyatt Oil Fields are in Colorado.  They are a bunch of old, abandoned oil wells that were revived by a new technique invented by Ellis Wyatt.  This has almost single-handedly revitalized the economy of Colorado.

The Wyatt Oil Fields appear in sections 111 and 161.

<h2>Atlas</h2>
As told in Atlas Shrugged, Atlas carried the world on his shoulders. But in the Greek Myths, the Titan Atlas stands on the earth and holds up the sky. In the statues that represent Atlas, the big round thing on his back represents the heavens, which, because of the apparent circular motion of the planets around the earth, were conceived of as being round. Some tellings of the Atlas myth have him carrying both the earth and the heavens on his back, but this appears to be a modern retelling; further research might confirm this.

<h2>Character names</h2>
Some of the character names are, or appear to be, puns, or have some other significance.  (See also Characters in Atlas Shrugged.)
When asked why so many of her names have syllables with many hard consonants like dag, tag, den, stad, Rand said that she just liked those sounds.

*Ragnar Danneskjold - sounds like &apos;Dane&apos;s Gold&apos;, a tribute paid by the medieval English to the Vikings to bribe them into being peaceful.  (However, note &quot;skjold&quot; means shield, not gold.)  However, the hero of Victor Hugo&apos;s first novel, Hans of Iceland becomes the first of the Counts of Dannesjköld.  In the 1970&apos;s, Rand told Marsha Familaro Enright that her use of this name was not plagiarism because there really were Counts of Dannesjköld.
*Robert Stadler - sounds like the German word for state, Staat. Dr. Stadler is a statist, in that he believes it appropriate and necessary for the state to fund scientific research.
*Francisco d&apos;Anconia - Rand&apos;s husband was Frank O&apos;Connor.
*John Galt - the name of a 19th century Scottish novelist, though this is apparently coincidental. Galt is close to &apos;Geld&apos; and &apos;gold&apos;. The name was probably used because it had to be such that it could become proverbial this would not be possible with a long, awkward name.

<h2>Crime</h2>
Common street crime is conspicuously absent in Atlas Shrugged. Characters walk the streets with no thought of being mugged or attacked.

<h2>Historical figures and events</h2>
Atlas Shrugged takes place in a world with a different history from our own, but there are some historical figures and events that are mentioned.

*Aristotle (section 152): Francisco d&apos;Anconia wrote a thesis on the influence of Aristotle&apos;s theory of the Immovable Mover.
*Dark Ages (section 161): Ragnar Danneskjold&apos;s piracy is likened to something out of the Dark Ages.
*Inquisition (section 152): Sebastian d&apos;Anconia flees Spain to escape persecution under the Inquisition.
*Middle Ages (section 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.
*Nero (section 152): Francisco d&apos;Anconia compares himself to the Emperor Nero.
*Patrick Henry (section 152): The eponym of Patrick Henry University.
*Vikings (section 161): It is said that Ragnar Danneskjold hides in the Norwegian fjords as the Vikings did in the Middle Ages.

<h2>Humor</h2>
In section 152, Francisco cracks that the Mexican government was promising a roast of pork every Sunday for every man, woman, child and abortion.

In section 152, Francisco lists the various buildings constructed for the workers of the San Sebastian Mines, and notes how they are all poorly built and can be expected to collapse, except for the church. &quot;The church, I think, will stand. They&apos;ll need it,&quot; he quips. Since the other things are things of value houses, roads, etc. it is ironic that only the church was built to last; to Rand and her heroes, a church is of no real value.

Almost every nation in the world except the United States is referred to as &quot;The People&apos;s State of...&quot;, and they are all, apparently, the recipients of relief supplies from the United States. In conversation, people casually refer to them as &quot;The People&apos;s State of...&quot; rather than just, say, France or Norway. It is obvious that people would not refer to countries by their formal names in casual conversation we don&apos;t call Canada &quot;The Dominion of Canada&quot; or Germany &quot;The Federal Republic of Germany&quot; so by having her characters do this Rand is exercising her dry wit.

<h2>Lying</h2>
The sympathetic characters of Atlas Shrugged do not tell lies. Even when they are clearly trying to conceal something, they do not rely on overt falsehood, even when it is obvious that they could do so without being found out. There are a few exceptions.

*In section 112 Brakeman tells Dagny Taggart he does not recall the name of the song he was whistling or where he heard it.
*In section 141 Francisco d&apos;Anconia tells the press he came to New York because of a hat check girl and the liverwurst at Moe&apos;s Delicatessen.
*In section 151 we learn Dagny Taggart once lied to her mother about a cut to her lip that Francisco had given her. This was the only lie she ever told.
*In section 152 Dagny Taggart asks Francisco if Richard Halley has written a fifth concerto. He is evasive and tells her that Halley has stopped writing. Is this a lie?
*In section 161, Hank Rearden tells Dagny that he was the one who invited Bertram Scudder to the Rearden&apos;s anniversary party. It was actually Lillian who invited him, and Rearden had been furious about it.
*In part 2/chapter 9, Eddie Willers tells Dagny Taggart that his hesitation and uncertainty is caused by the illegality of her directions.  In fact, Eddie was shocked by the evidence and thus realization of her affair with Hank Rearden.

<h2>People&apos;s States</h2>
Almost every nation that is mentioned, other than the United States, is referred to as a &quot;People&apos;s State&quot;. These include:

* The People&apos;s State of England
* The People&apos;s State of France
* The People&apos;s State of India
* The People&apos;s State of Mexico
* The People&apos;s State of Norway
* The People&apos;s State of Portugal
* The People&apos;s State of Turkey

The leaders of these countries are given the title the &quot;Head of the People&apos;s State,&quot; and called &quot;Mr._____&quot; (or &quot;Senor&quot;____). The President of the United States is refered to as &quot;Mr. Thompson&quot; and called the &quot;Head of the State,&quot; which seems to imply the US is on its way to becoming a People&apos;s State as well.

<h2>Religion</h2>
In section 152 Francisco tells Dagny he named the San Sebastian Mines after his ancestor Sebastian d&apos;Anconia, a man they both honor deeply. This, to Dagny, is blasphemy the only kind of blasphemy she understands.

<h2>Social classes</h2>
Rand is sometimes called an elitist. This claim is probably accurate if we allow for the fact that Rand had her own standard of eliteness throughout Atlas Shrugged, virtue is equated with creative ability.  It is, however, worth noting that in Atlas Shrugged, there are no characters with creative ability which do not function as author surrogate characters (most notably Dagny Taggart); conversely, all of the characters which disagree with the author are unintelligent and creatively bankrupt, and usually actively destructive.  Compare to the real world, where scientists, inventors, artists and industrialists often have wildly varying and strongly conflicting desires and opinions.

Different social classes are represented among both the heroes and the villains of Atlas Shrugged. Among the heroes, John Galt and Hank Rearden are from working class backgrounds, while Dagny Taggart and Francisco d&apos;Anconia are from wealthy families. Among the villains, Fred Kinnan is from a working class background, while James Taggart and Betty Pope are from wealthy families.

Atlas Shrugged cover

Atlas Shrugged is a novel by Ayn Rand, first published in 1957 in the USA. It is a highly philosophical and allegorical story that deals with themes of Rand&apos;s own Objectivist philosophy.

Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

<h1>Philosophy and writing</h1>

The theme of Atlas Shrugged is that independent, rational thought is the motor that powers the world. In the book, &quot;men of the mind&quot; go on strike, allowing the collapse of what only they hold together   a peaceful cohesiveness Rand claims that humans may create wherever forceful human interference is absent. Given no alternative, they remove themselves from the &quot;looters.&quot; The book is rooted in Objectivism, the philosophical system founded by Rand.

Rand suggests that society stagnates when independence and individual achievement are discouraged or demonized, and that, inversely, a society will become more prosperous as it allows, encourages, and rewards independence and individual achievement. Rand believed that independence flourishes to the extent that people are free, and that achievement is rewarded best when private property is respected strictly. She advocated laissez-faire capitalism as the political system that is most consistent with these beliefs. These considerations make Atlas Shrugged a highly political book, especially in its portrayal of fascism, socialism and communism, or indeed any form of state intervention in societal affairs, as fatally flawed. However, Rand claimed that it is not a fundamentally political book, but that the politics portrayed in the novel are a result of her attempt to display her image of the ideal man and the position of the human mind in society.

Rand argues that independence and individual achievement drive the world, and should be embraced.  Her worldview requires a &quot;rational&quot; moral code. She disputes the notion that self-sacrifice is a virtue, and is similarly dismissive of human faith in a god or higher being. The book positions itself against Christianity specifically, often directly within the characters&apos; dialogue.

<h1> Setting </h1>

Exactly when Atlas Shrugged is meant to take place is kept deliberately vague. In section 152, the population of New York City is given as 7 million. The historical New York City reached 7 million people in the 1930s, which might place the novel sometime after that. There are many early 20th century technologies available, but the political situation is clearly different from actual history. One interpretation is that the novel takes place a hundred (or perhaps hundreds) of years in the future, implying that since the world lapsed into its socialistic morass, a global-wide stagnation has occurred in technological growth, population growth, and indeed growth of any kind; the wars, economic depressions, and other events of the 20th century would be a distant memory to all but scholars and academicians. This would be in line with Rand&apos;s ideas and commentary on other novels depicting utopian and dystopian societies. The concept of societal stagnation in the wake of collectivist systems is central to the plot of another of Rand&apos;s works, Anthem.

All countries outside the US have become, or become during the novel, &quot;People&apos;s States&quot;. There are many examples of early 20th century technology in Atlas Shrugged, but no post-war advances such as nuclear weapons, helicopters, or computers. Jet planes are mentioned briefly as being a relatively new technology. Television is a novelty that has yet to assume any cultural significance, while radio broadcasts are prominent. Though Rand does not use in the book many of the technological innovations available while she was writing, she introduces some advanced, fictional inventions (e.g., sound-based weapon of mass destruction, torture device, power plant).

Most of the action in Atlas Shrugged occurs in the United States. However, there are important events around the world, such as in the People&apos;s States of Mexico, Chile, and Argentina, and piracy at sea.

<h1>Plot</h1>

A section by section analysis of Atlas Shrugged is available on Wikibooks.

The basic plot follows the character of Dagny Taggart, a no-nonsense railroad executive, who struggles with the frustrations of the fundamental ideological, political and economic changes happening in the world around her.  Other major characters include Hank Rearden, a highly successful steel tycoon, and Francisco d&apos;Anconia, a prodigy who is also heir to a fortune based on the copper industry.

<h1>Film adaptation</h1>
Rights to the novel Atlas Shrugged were puchased by the Baldwin Entertainment Group in 2003 with the intent of producing a feature-length film. Company leader Howard Baldwin was quoted in September 2004 as saying &quot;...everything is on track and [the movie] hasn’t been held up one bit.... I assure you that this will be a big movie and IT WILL GET MADE.&quot;  Two works of Rand&apos;s The Fountainhead and We the Living  have been adapted into movies so far.

Anthropology (from the Greek word         , &quot;human&quot;) consists of the study of humankind (see genus Homo).  It is holistic in two senses: it is concerned with all humans at all times, and with all dimensions of humanity.  A primary trait that traditionally distinguished anthropology from other humanistic disciplines is an emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons. This distinction has, however, become increasingly the subject of controversy and debate, with anthropological methods now being commonly applied in single society/group studies.

In the United States, &apos;anthropology&apos; is traditionally divided into four sub-disciplines: 
* physical anthropology, which studies primate behavior, human evolution, and population genetics; this field is also sometimes called biological anthropology.
* cultural anthropology, (called social anthropology in the United Kingdom and now often known as socio-cultural anthropology).  Areas studied by cultural anthropologists include social networks, diffusion, social behavior, kinship patterns, law, politics, ideology, religion, beliefs, patterns in production and consumption, exchange, socialization, gender, and other expressions of culture, with strong emphasis on the importance of fieldwork, i.e living among the social group being studied for an extended period of time; 
* linguistic anthropology, which studies variation in language across time and space, the social uses of language, and the relationship between language and culture; and
* archaeology, which studies the material remains of human societies. Archaeology itself is normally treated as a separate (but related) field in the rest of the world, although closely related to the anthropological field of material culture, which deals with physical objects created or used within a living or past group as mediums of understanding its cultural values.

More recently, some anthropology programs began dividing the field into two, one emphasizing the humanities and critical theory, the other emphasizing the natural sciences and empirical observation.

<h1>Historical and institutional context</h1>
:Main Article: History of anthropology 
The anthropologist Eric Wolf once characterized anthropology as the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences.  Understanding how anthropology developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.

Contemporary anthropologists claim a number of earlier thinkers as their forebearers and the discipline has several sources. However, anthropology can best be understood as an outgrowth of the Age of Enlightenment. It was during this period that Europeans attempted systematically to study human behavior. Traditions of jurisprudence, history, philology and sociology developed during this time and informed the development of the social sciences of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the  romantic reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as Herder and later Wilhelm Dilthey whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of modernity: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people&apos;s experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed.  As Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels observed in the 1840s:

:All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.  They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe.  In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes.  In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new   and to some confusing or disturbing   cultural expressions.  These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from natural history (expounded by authors such as Buffon). This was the study of human beings - typically people living in European  colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that Lewis Henry Morgan could write monographs on both The League of the Iroquois and The American Beaver and His Works. This is also why the material culture of &apos;civilized&apos; nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in Natural History Museums with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. This being said, curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European chauvinism, since its relationship to imperialism was and is complex.

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form - by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled A Hundred Years of Anthropology. At the time, the field was dominated by &apos;the comparative method&apos;. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary &apos;living fossils&apos; that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced Polynesian migrations across the Pacific Ocean for instance - although some of them believed it originated in Egypt. Finally, the concept of race was actively discussed as a way to classify - and rank - human beings based on inherent biological difference.

In the twentieth century academic disciplines began to organize around three main domains.  The &quot;sciences&quot; seeks to derive natural laws through reproducible and falsifiable experiments.    The &quot;humanities&quot; reflected an attempt to study different national traditions, in the form of history and the arts, as an attempt to provide people in emerging nation-states with a sense of coherence.  The &quot;social sciences&quot; emerged at this time as an attempt to develop scientific methods to address social phenomena, in an attempt to provide a universal basis for social knowledge.  Anthropology does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains.

Drawing on the methods of the natural sciences as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured &quot;participant-observation&quot;   and drawing on the new theory of evolution through natural selection, they proposed the scientific study of a new object: &quot;humankind,&quot; conceived of as a whole.  Crucial to this study is the concept &quot;culture,&quot; which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens   and perhaps all species of genus Homo   from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices.  Thus, &quot;culture&quot; not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains.  Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

<h1>Anthropology in the U.S.</h1>
Anthropology in the United States was pioneered by staff of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Smithsonian Institution&apos;s Bureau of American Ethnology, such as John Wesley Powell and Frank Hamilton Cushing.  Academic Anthropology was established by Franz Boas, who used his positions at Columbia University and the American Museum of Natural History to train and develop multiple generations of students. Boasian anthropology was politically active and suspicious of research dictated by the U.S. government or wealthy patrons. It was also rigorously empirical and skeptical of over-generalizations and attempts to establish universal laws. Boas studied immigrant children in order to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable and that human conduct and behavior was the result of nurture rather than nature.

Drawing on his German roots, he argued that the world was full of distinct &apos;cultures&apos; rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little &apos;civilization&apos; they had. Boas felt that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations like those made in the natural sciences were not possible. In doing so Boas fought discrimination against immigrants, African Americans, and Native North Americans. Many American anthropologists adopted Boas&apos; agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular targets for anthropologists today.

Boas&apos;s first generation of students included Alfred Kroeber, Robert Lowie, and Edward Sapir. All of these scholars produced richly detailed studies which were first to describe Native North America. In doing so they provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Their focus on Native American languages also helped establish linguistics as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on Indo-European languages.

The publication of Alfred Kroeber&apos;s textbook Anthropology marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material the urge to generalize grew. This was most obvious in the &apos;Culture and Personality&apos; studies carried out by younger Boasians such as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up. While such works as Coming of Age in Samoa and The Chrysanthemum and the Sword remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia&apos;s anthropology department, but she was sidelined by Ralph Linton and Mead was limited to her offices at the  AMNH.

<h1>Anthropology in Britain</h1>
Whereas Boas picked his opponents to pieces through attention to detail, in Britain modern anthropology was formed by rejecting historical reconstruction in the name of a science of society that focused on analyzing how societies held together in the present.

The two most important names in this tradition were Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown and Bronislaw Malinowski, both of whom released seminal works in 1922. Radcliffe-Brown&apos;s initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands was carried out in the old style, but after reading Émile Durkheim he published an account of his research (entitled simply The Andaman Islanders) which drew heavily on the French sociologist. Over time he developed an approach known as structural-functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously.  Malinowski, on the other hand, advocated an unhyphenated &apos;functionalism&apos; which examined how society functioned to meet individual needs. Malinowski is best known not for his theory, however, but for his detailed ethnography and advances in methodology. His classic Argonauts of the Western Pacific advocated getting &apos;the native&apos;s point of view&apos; and an approach to field work that became standard in the field.

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown&apos;s success stem from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions which furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for &apos;Social Anthropology&apos; by teaching at universities across the Commonwealth. From the late 1930s until the post-war period a string of monographs and edited volumes appeared which cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology. Famous ethnographies include The Nuer by Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard and The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi by Meyer Fortes, while well known edited volumes include African Systems of Kinship and Marriage and African Political Systems.

<h1>Anthropology in France</h1>
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions. Most commentators consider Marcel Mauss to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss was a member of  Durkheim&apos;s Annee Sociologique group, and while Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as Henri Hubert and Robert Hertz) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies which were not as &apos;differentiated&apos; as European nation states. In particular, Mauss&apos;s Essay on the Gift was to prove of enduring relevance in anthropological studies of exchange and reciprocity.

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as surrealism and  primitivism which drew on ethnography for inspiration. Marcel Griaule and Michel Leiris are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ethnologie was restricted to museums, and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of folklore.

Above all, however, it was Claude Lévi-Strauss who helped institutionalize anthropology in France. In addition to the enormous influence his structuralism exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology while training influential students such as Maurice Godelier and Francoise Heritier who would prove influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France&apos;s anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally-funded research laboratories rather than academic departments in universities.

<h1>Anthropology after World War Two</h1>
Before WWII British &apos;social anthropology&apos; and American &apos;cultural anthropology&apos; were still distinct traditions. It was after the war that the two would blend to create a &apos;sociocultural&apos; anthropology.

In the 1950s and mid-1960s anthropology tended increasingly to model itself after the natural sciences. Some, such as Lloyd Fallers and Clifford Geertz, focused on processes of modernization by which newly independent states could develop. Others, such as Julian Steward and Leslie White focused on how societies evolve and fit their ecological niche - an approach popularized by Marvin Harris. Economic anthropology as influenced by Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton focused on how traditional economics ignored cultural and social factors. In England, British Social Anthropology&apos;s paradigm began to fragment as Max Gluckman and Peter Worsley experimented with Marxism and authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach incorporated Lévi-Strauss&apos;s structuralism into their work.

Structuralism also influenced a number of development in 1960s and 1970s, including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis. Authors such as David Schneider, Clifford Geertz, and Marshall Sahlins developed a more fleshed-out concept of culture as a web of meaning or signification, which proved very popular within and beyond the discipline. In keeping with the times, much of anthropology became politicized through the Algerian War of Independence and opposition to the Vietnam War; Marxism became a more and more popular theoretical approach in the discipline. By the 1970s the authors of volumes such as Reinventing Anthropology worried about anthropology&apos;s relevance.

In the 1980s issues of power, such as those examined in Eric Wolf&apos;s Europe and the People Without History - were central to the discipline. Books like Anthropology and the Colonial Encounter pondered anthropology&apos;s ties to colonial inequality, while the immense popularity of theorists such as Antonio Gramsci and Michel Foucault moved issues of power and hegemony into the spotlight. Gender and sexuality became a popular topic, as did the relationship between history and anthropology, influenced by Marshall Sahlins (again) who drew on Lévi-Strauss and Fernand Braudel to examine the relationship between social structure and individual agency.

In the late 1980s and 1990s authors such as George Marcus and James Clifford pondered ethnographic authority, particularly how and why anthropological knowledge was possible and authoritative. This was part of a more general trend of postmodernism that was popular contemporaneously. Currently anthropologists have begun to pay attention to globalization, medicine and biotechnology, indigenous rights, and the anthropology of Europe.

<h1>Politics of anthropology</h1>
Anthropology&apos;s traditional involvement with nonwestern cultures has involved it in politics in many different ways.

Some political problems arise simply because anthropologists usually have more power than the people they study. Some have argued that the discipline is a form of colonialist theft in which the anthropologist gains power at the expense of subjects. The anthropologist, they argue, can gain yet more power by exploiting knowledge and artifacts of the people she or he studies while the people she or he studies gain nothing, or even lose, in exchange. An example of this exploitative relationship can been seen in the collaboration in Africa prior to World War II of British anthropologists and colonial forces. More recently, there have been newfound concerns about bioprospecting, along with struggles for self-representation for native peoples and the repatriation of indigenous remains and material culture.

Other political controversies come from American anthropology&apos;s emphasis on cultural relativism and its long-standing antipathy to the concept of race. As mentioned above, Boas was a well-known social reformer whose activism and anthropological teaching went hand in hand. The development of sociobiology in the late 1960s was opposed by cultural anthropologists such as Marshall Sahlins, who argued that these positions were reductive.  While authors such John Randal Baker continued to develop the biological concept of race into the 1970s, the rise of genetics has proven to be central to developments on this front. As genetics continues to advance as a science, biological anthropologists such as Jonathan Marks have continued to refine their opposition to folk notions of race while addressing recent developments in biology.

Finally, anthropology has a history of entanglement with government intelligence agencies and anti-war politics. Boas publicly objected to US participation World War I and the collaboration of some anthropologists with US intelligence. In contrast, many of Boas&apos; anthropologist contemporaries were active in the war effort in some form, including dozens who served in the Office of Strategic Services and the Office of War Information. In the 1950s, the American Anthropological Association provided the CIA information on the area specialities of its members, and a number of anthropologists participated in the U.S. government&apos;s Operation Camelot during the war in Vietnam. At the same time, many other anthropologists were active in the antiwar movement and passed resolutions in the American Anthropological Association (AAA) condemning anthropological involvement in covert operations. Anthropologists were also vocal in their opposition to the war in Iraq although their was no consensus amongst all practitioners of the discipline.

Professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state. Their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings. The British Association for Social Anthropology has called these scholarships ethically dangerous and divise For example, the British Association for Social Anthropology has condemned the CIA&apos;s Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program, which anonymously funds anthropology students at US universities in preparation for those students to spy for the United States government. The AAA&apos;s current &apos;Statement of Professional Responsibility&apos; clearly states that &quot;in relation with their own government and with host governments... no secret research, no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given.&quot;

Anthropology is the study of human diversity--diversity of body and behavior, in the past and present.  Anthropology consists of four subfields or subdisciplines:

Physical anthropology--studies the diversity of the human body in the past and present. It includes how we acquired the structure of our body over time, that is human evolution, as well as differences and relationships between human populations today and their adaptations to their local environments.  It also sometimes includes the evolution and diversity of our nearest relatives, the primates (apes and monkeys).

Cultural anthropology--studies the diversity of human behavior in the present.  This is what most anthropologists do and what most of the public sees when they look at &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine or the &quot;Discovery&quot; channel on TV.  Cultural anthropologists travel to foreign societies (although it is possible to do anthropology on your own society!), live among the people there, and try as much as they can to understand how those people live.

Archaeology--studies the diversity of human behavior in the past.  Since it studies how people lived in the past, these people are not available for us to visit and talk to...or at least, not people who are currently living in the same way that their ancestors did in the past.  Therefore, archaeologists must depend on the artifacts and features that the people produced in the past and attempt to reconstruct their vanished way of life from those remnants of their culture.

Linguistic anthropology--studies the diversity of human language in the past and present.  While language is naturally a part of culture, it is such a huge topic that anthropologists have separated it into its own area of study.  Linguistic anthropologists are concerned about the development of languages, perhaps even back to the first forms of language, and how language changes over time.  They are also interested in how different contemporary languages differ today, how they are related, and how we can learn about things like migration and diffusion from that data.  They also ask how language is related to and reflects on other aspects of culture.

Other sciences study humans too, of course.  History, economics, psychology, sociology, even biology and chemistry can study humans. How is anthropology different?

The answer is the anthropological perspective, that is, the way that anthropology approaches the subject and thinks about or studies humans and their behavior.  The anthropological perspective has three components:

(1) cross-cultural or comparative--anthropology investigates humans in every form that they take.  We are interested to see the entire spectrum of human bodies and behaviors, trying to learn the range of humanity--all the ways that we can be human.  By seeing humans in their every manifestation, and comparing those manifestations to each other, we can ask what is possible for humans and what is necessary for humans.

(2) holistic--anthropology tries to relate every part of culture to every other part.  We understand that the various parts of culture are connected to each other and that certain combinations tend to occur or not to occur (for example, there are no hunting and gathering cultures that traditionally lived in cities...that&apos;s just impossible!).  We are also interested in how a people&apos;s cultures is connected to their environment; again, without high technology, you are not going to see farming or cities in the middle of the desert or the arctic.

(3) relativistic--this is the most profound yet controversial part of the anthropological perspective.  Relativism means that the rules or norms or values of a culture are relative to that specific culture.  In other words, say, monogamy may be normal or preferred in one culture, but polygamy may be normal or preferred in another.  The point is that different cultures believe different things or value different things or even mean different things with perhaps identical-looking behaviors or objects.  In one culture, waving your hand might be a greeting, and in another culture it might be an insult.

When you go to another culture, or even just interact with another culture (for example, when you are doing international business), you cannot assume that other people understand things the same way you do.  In fact, you should assume that they don&apos;t!  And you certainly should not judge or evaluate them from your own culture&apos;s perspective--if you were in a headhunter society, you might think they were horrible people for keeping heads in their house, but if they came to visit you, they might think you were a horrible person for not having heads in your house!

The point is that, if we want to understand other people properly, we must see what their behaviors or words or concepts mean to them, not what they would mean to us.  Meaning is relative to the culture that creates that meaning.  This is not to say that all things are true or even that all things are good.  Some things are true (like the world being round) no matter what people think; those are facts.  And &quot;good&quot; is a value judgment, so it has no place in anthropology.  What we are saying in relativism is that all value judgments are made from cultural perspective, and if you were to take a different cultural perspective, you would understand or judge the exact same phenomenon in the exact opposite way!

How does anthropology study culture?

One other way that anthropology is unique among the sciences that study humans is by its emphasis on &quot;fieldwork&apos;&quot;  You cannot get to know another culture just by reading about it or watching movies about it.  At best, you could learn what other people have already discovered, but you could not learn anything new.  So anthropology requires actually going to that society and living with and living like that society as much as possible.  This is called participant observation (p.13).  This depends crucially on making friends with people in the society, who will teach you and include you in their activities--and informant.  Then, as much as possible, you will try to eat their food, speak their language, and live their lives, often actually residing with a family in that society.  It is not easy work, and it is not always fun, but there is no better way to learn.

Archaeology  or  archeology (from the Greek words         = ancient and       = word/speech/discourse) is the study of human cultures through the recovery, documentation and analysis of material remains and environmental data, including architecture, artefacts, biofacts, human remains, and landscapes.

The goals of archaeology are to document and explain the origins and development of human culture, understand culture history, chronicle cultural evolution, and study human behaviour and ecology, for both prehistoric and historic societies.

<h1>Ontology and definition</h1>
In the Old World, archaeology has tended to focus on the study of physical remains, the methods used in recovering them and the theoretical and philosophical underpinnings in achieving the subject&apos;s goals.  The discipline&apos;s roots in antiquarianism and the study of Latin and Ancient Greek provided it with a natural affinity with the field of history. In the New World, archaeology is more commonly devoted to the study of human societies and is treated as one of the four subfields of Anthropology.  The other subfields of anthropology supplement the findings of archaeology in a holistic manner.  These subfields are cultural anthropology, which studies behavioural, symbolic, and material dimensions of culture; linguistics, which studies language, including the origins of language and language groups; and physical anthropology, which includes the study of human evolution and physical and genetic characteristics. Other disciplines also supplement archaeology, such as paleontology, paleozoology, paleoethnobotany, paleobotany, geography, geology, art history, and classics.

Archaeology has been described as a craft that enlists the sciences to illuminate the humanities. Writing in 1948, the American archaeologist Walter Taylor asserted that &quot;Archaeology is neither history nor anthropology. As an autonomous discipline, it consists of a method and a set of specialised techniques for the gathering, or &apos;production&apos; of cultural information&quot;.

Archaeology is an approach to understanding human culture through its material remains regardless of chronology. In England, archaeologists have uncovered the long-lost layouts of medieval villages abandoned after the crises of the 14th century and the equally lost layouts of 17th century parterre gardens swept away by a change in fashion. In downtown New York City archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the Black burial ground.  Traditional Archaeology is viewed as the study of pre-historical human cultures; that is cultures that existed before the development of writing for that culture.  Historical archaeology is the study of post-writing cultures.

In the study of relatively recent cultures, which have been observed and studied by Western scholars, archaeology is closely allied with ethnography. This is the case in large parts of North America, Oceania, Siberia, and other places where the study of archaeology mingles with the living traditions of the cultures being studied. Kennewick_Man is an example of archaeology interacting with modern culture.  In the study of cultures that were literate or had literate neighbours, history and archaeology supplement one another for broader understanding of the complete cultural context, as at Hadrian&apos;s Wall.
Excavation is just one stage of archaeological research.

<h1>Importance and applicability</h1>

Most of human history is not described by any written records. Writing did not exist anywhere in the world until about 5000 years ago, and only spread among a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilisations. In contrast Homo sapiens have existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution).  These civilisations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they have been open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a civilisation that is literate at some levels, many important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the formative early years of human civilisation - the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities - must come from archaeology.

Even where written records do exist, they are invariably incomplete or biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite classes, such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple. The literacy even of an aristocracy has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the rest of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases of the literate classes, and cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record is nearer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own inaccuracies, such as sampling bias and differential preservation.

In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal. Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies.

This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon&apos;s Mines. When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology, below). However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of the modern state of archaeology.

<h1>Goals</h1>

There is still a tremendous emphasis in the practice of archaeology on field techniques and methodologies. These include the tasks of surveying areas in order to find new sites, digging sites in order to unearth the cultural remains therein, and classification and preservation techniques in order to analyse and keep these remains. Every phase of this process can be a source of information.

The goals of archaeology are not always the same. There are at least three broad, distinct theories of exactly what archaeological research should do. (These are beyond the scope of the present discussion, and are discussed at length below.) Nevertheless, there is much common ground.

<h2>Academic sub-disciplines</h2>
Main article: Archaeological sub-disciplines

As with most academic disciplines, there are a very large number of archaeological sub-disciplines characterised by a specific method or type of material (e.g. lithic analysis, music_(archaeology), archaeobotany), geographical or chronological focus (e.g. Near Eastern archaeology, Medieval archaeology), other thematic concern (e.g. landscape archaeology), or a specific archaeological culture or civilisation (e.g. Egyptology).

<h2>Cultural resources management</h2>
Cultural resources management (CRM) (also called heritage management in Britain) is a branch of archaeology that accounts for most research done in the United States and much of that in western Europe as well. In the United States, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and most of the archaeology done in that country today proceeds from either direct or related requirements of that measure. In the United States, the vast majority of taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped to preserve much of that nation&apos;s history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways. Along with other statutes, this mandates that no construction project on public land or involving public funds may damage an unstudied archaeological site.

The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects. Since 1990 PPG 16 has required planners to consider archaeology as a material consideration in determining applications for new development. As a result, numerous archaeological organisations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the developer&apos;s expense.

Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of cultural sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction. This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction. If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation. If initial survey and/or test excavation indicates the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely. CRM is a thriving entity, especially in the United States and Europe where archaeologists from private companies and all levels of government engage in the practice of their discipline.

Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized. CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour.

<h1>Field methods</h1>

<h2>Survey</h2>
A modern archaeological project often begins with a survey. Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region. Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and middens, within a site. Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.

Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology. Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there. Gordon Willey pioneered the technique of regional settlement pattern survey in 1949 in the Viru Valley of coastal Peru, and survey of all levels became prominent with the rise of processual archaeology some years later.

Survey work has many benefits if performed as a preliminary exercise to, or even in place of, excavation. It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artefacts. (Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling methods.) It avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation. It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as settlement patterns and settlement structure. Survey data are commonly assembled into maps, which may show surface features and/or artefact distribution.

The simplest survey technique is surface survey. It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanised transport, to search for features or artefacts visible on the surface. Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation. Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers, corers, and shovel test pits.

Aerial survey is conducted using cameras attached to aircraft, balloons, or even kites. A bird&apos;s-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. Plants growing above a stone structure, such as a wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial survey also employs infrared, ground-penetrating radar wavelengths, and thermography.

Geophysical survey is the most effective way to see beneath the ground. Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth&apos;s magnetic field caused by iron artefacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens. Devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used. Most soils are moist below the surface, which gives them a relatively low resistivity. Features such as hard-packed floors or concentrations of stone have a higher resistivity.

Although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on English Civil War battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a nineteenth century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to the archaeological record where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context.  In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the Portable Antiquities Scheme.

Regional survey in maritime archaeology uses side-scan sonar.

<h2>Excavation</h2>
Archaeological excavation existed when the field was still the domain of amateurs, and it remains the source of the majority of data recovered in most field projects. It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context.

Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their provenance or provenience, be recorded. This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well. Similarly, their association, or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis. This allows the archaeologist to deduce what artefacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity. For example, excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artefacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures.

Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research. Also, as a destructive process, it carries ethical concerns. As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety. Sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey. It is common for large mechanical equipment, such as backhoes (JCBs), to be used in excavation, especially to remove the topsoil (overburden), though this method is increasingly used with great caution. Following this it is usual to hand-clean the exposed area with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent.

The next task is to produce a site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation. Features dug into the natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions in order to produce a visible archaeological section for recording. Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each. All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.

<h1>Post-excavation analysis</h1>
Once artefacts and structures have been excavated, or collected from surface surveys, it is necessary to properly study them, to gain as much data as possible. This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is normally the most time-consuming part of the archaeological investigation. It is not uncommon for the final excavation reports on major sites to take years to be published.

At its most basic, the artefacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections, in order to classify them typologically and to identify other sites with similar artefact assemblages. However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science, meaning that artefacts can be dated and their compositions examined. The bones, plants and pollen collected from a site can all be analysed (using the techniques of zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, and palynology), while any texts can usually be deciphered.

These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known and therefore contribute greatly to the understanding of a site.

<h1>History of archaeology</h1>
Main article: History of archaeology

The history of archaeology has been one of increasing professionalisation, and the use of an increasing range of techniques, to obtain as much data on the site being examined as possible.

Excavations of ancient monuments and the collection of antiquities have been taking place for thousands of years, but these were mostly for the extraction of valuable or aesthetically pleasing artefacts.

It was only in the 19th century that the systematic study of the past through its physical remains began to be carried out. Archaeological methods were developed by both interested amateurs and professionals, including Augustus Pitt Rivers and William Flinders Petrie.

This process was continued in the 20th century by such people as Mortimer Wheeler, whose highly disciplined approach to excavation greatly improved the quality of evidence that could be obtained.

During the 20th century, the development of urban archaeology and then rescue archaeology have been important factors, as has the development of archaeological science, which has greatly increased the amount of data that it is possible to obtain.

<h1>Archaeological theory</h1>
Main article: Archaeological theory

There is no single theory of archaeology, and even definitions are disputed. Until the mid-20th century and the introduction of technology, there was a general consensus that archaeology was closely related to both history and anthropology. The first major phase in the history of archaeological theory is commonly referred to as cultural, or culture, history, which was developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

In the 1960s, a number of young, primarily American archaeologists, such as Lewis Binford, rebelled against the paradigms of cultural history. They proposed a &quot;New Archaeology&quot;, which would be more &quot;scientific&quot; and &quot;anthropological&quot;, with hypothesis testing and the scientific method very important parts of what became known as processual archaeology.

In the 1980s, a new movement arose led by the British archaeologists Michael Shanks, Christopher Tilley, Daniel Miller, and Ian Hodder. It questioned processualism&apos;s appeals to science and impartiality and emphasised the importance of relativism, becoming known as post-processual archaeology. However, this approach has been criticised by processualists as lacking scientific rigour. The validity of both processualism and post-procuessualism is still under debate.

Archaeological theory now borrows from a wide range of influences, including neo-Darwinian evolutionary thought, phenomenology, postmodernism, agency theory, cognitive science, Functionalism, gender-based and Feminist archaeology, and Systems theory.

<h1>Public archaeology</h1>

Early archaeology was largely an attempt to uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Such pursuits continue to fascinate the public, portrayed in books (such as King Solomon&apos;s Mines) and films (such as The Mummy and Raiders of the Lost Ark).

Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as Copán and the Valley of the Kings, but the stuff of modern archaeology is not so reliably sensational. In addition, archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in modern survey, excavation, and data processing techniques. Some archaeologists refer to such portrayals as &quot;pseudoarchaeology&quot;.

Nevertheless, archaeology has profited from its portrayal in the mainstream media. Many practitioners point to the childhood excitement of Indiana Jones films and Tomb Raider games as the inspiration for them to enter the field. Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support, the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed. Without a strong public interest in the subject, often sparked by significant finds and celebrity archaeologists, it would be a great deal harder for archaeologists to gain the political and financial support they require.

In the UK, popular archaeology programmes such as Time Team and Meet the Ancestors have resulted in a huge upsurge in public interest.  Where possible, archaeologists now make more provision for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did. However, the move towards being more professional has meant that volunteer places are now relegated to unskilled labour, and even this is less freely available than before. Developer-funded excavation necessitates a well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately, observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines. Certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project. There is also a flourishing industry selling places on commercial training excavations and archaeological holiday tours.

Archaeologists prize local knowledge and often liaise with local historical and archaeological societies. Anyone looking to get involved in the field without having to pay to do so should contact a local group.

<h2>Pseudoarchaeology</h2>
Main article: Pseudoarchaeology.

Pseudoarchaeology is an umbrella term for all activities that claim to be archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted archaeological practices. It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity. Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in  Post-processualism.

An example of this type is the writing of Erich von Däniken. His Chariots of the Gods (1968), together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilisation on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilisations. This theory, known as palaeocontact theory, is not exclusively Däniken&apos;s nor did the idea originate with him. Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind.

<h2>Looting</h2>
Looting of archaeological sites by people in search of hoards of buried treasure is an ancient problem. For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs were looted in antiquity. The advent of archaeology has made ancient sites objects of great scientific and public interest, but it has also attracted unwelcome attention to the works of past peoples. A brisk commercial demand for artefacts encourages looting and the illicit antiquities trade, which smuggles items abroad to private collectors. Looters damage the integrity of a historic site, deny archaeologists valuable information that would be learnt from excavation, and often are considered to be robbing local people of their heritage.

The popular consciousness often associates looting with poor Third World countries. Many are former homes to many well-known ancient civilisations but lack the financial resources or political will to protect even the most significant sites. Certainly, the high prices that intact objects can command relative to a poor farmer&apos;s income make looting a tempting financial proposition for some local people. However, looting has taken its toll in places as rich and populous as the United States and Western Europe as well. Abandoned towns of the ancient Sinagua people of Arizona, clearly visible in the desert landscape, have been destroyed in large numbers by treasure hunters. Sites in more densely populated areas farther east have also been looted. Where looting is proscribed by law it takes place under cover of night, with the metal detector a common instrument used to identify profitable places to dig.

<h2>Public outreach</h2>
Motivated by a desire to halt looting, curb pseudoarchaeology, and to secure greater public funding and appreciation for their work, archaeologists are mounting public-outreach campaigns. They seek to stop looting by informing prospective artefact collectors of the provenance of these goods, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting and the danger that it poses to science and their own heritage. Common methods of public outreach include press releases and the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation.

The final audience for archaeologists&apos; work is the public and it is increasingly realised that their work is ultimately being done to benefit and inform them. The putative social benefits of local heritage awareness are also being promoted with initiatives to increase civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects and better interpretation and presentation of existing sites.

<h2>Descendant peoples</h2>

In the United States, examples such as the case of Kennewick Man have illustrated the tensions between Native Americans and archaeologists which can be summarised as a conflict between a need to remain respectful towards burials sacred sites and the academic benefit from studying them. For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artefacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study. In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied. Furthermore, Western archaeologists&apos; views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples. The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic. From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present. To an archaeologist, the past is long-gone and must be reconstructed through its material remains; to indigenous peoples, it is often still alive.

As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies. This contradictory situation was addressed by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains. Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study.

Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space. To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance. Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites in order to give them some protection from being developed. Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.

While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved. Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders&apos; aid in interpreting their finds. There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.

A new trend in the heated controversy between First Nations groups and scientists is the repatriation of native artifacts to the original descendents. An example of this occurred June 21, 2005, when a community members and elders from a number of the 10 Algonquian nations in the Ottawa area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation in Kanawagi, Quebec, to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods — some dating back 6,000 years.

The ceremony marked the end of a journey spanning thousands of years and many miles. The remains and artifacts, including beads, tools and weapons, were originally excavated from various sites in the Ottawa Valley, including Morrison and the Allumette Islands. They had been part of the Canadian Museum of Civilization’s research collection for decades, some since the late 1800s. Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional cedar and birchbark boxes lined with cedar chips, muskrat and beaver pelts.

Now, an inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 90 boxes of various sizes are buried. Although negotiations were at times tense between the Kitigan Zibi community and museum, they were able to reach agreement. (Source:  Canadian Geographic Online.)

Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic, and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. (Veterinary science is often excluded from the definition.)

<h1>Agriculture and agricultural science </h1>

The two terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:

:Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.

:Agronomy is research and development related to studying and improving plant-based agriculture.

Agricultural sciences include research and development on:

* Production techniques (e.g., irrigation management, recommended nitrogen inputs)
* Improving production in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of drought-resistant crops, development of new pesticides, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro cell culture techniques)
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of dairy products)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., soil degradation, waste management, bioremediation)
* Theoretical production ecology, relating to crop production modelling.

<h1> Agricultural science: a local science </h1>

With the exception of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather, soil characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible.

<h1> History of agricultural science </h1>
Main Article: History of agricultural science

Agricultural science today is very different from what it was before about 1950. Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries, often referred to as the Green Revolution, was closely tied to progress made in  selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and phytosanitary products.

However, environmental damage due to intensive agriculture, industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields (e.g., integrated pest management, waste treatment technologies, landscape architecture, genomics).

New technologies, such as biotechnology and computer science (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including genetic engineering, agrophysics, improved statistical analysis, and precision farming.

<h1> Agricultural science and agriculture crisis</h1>

Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world&apos;s population while preventing biosafety problems that may affect human health and the environment. This requires promoting good management of natural resources and respect for the environment.

Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as mad cow disease and issues such as the use of genetically modified organisms) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.

Alchemy is an early protoscientific practice combining elements of chemistry, physics, astrology, art, semiotics, metallurgy, medicine, and mysticism. These practices were usually used outside of what is now known as the scientific method, however, alchemy can be regarded as the precursor of the modern science of chemistry prior to the formulation of the scientific method.

The most well known goal of alchemy was the transmutation of any metal into either gold or silver. Alchemists also tried to create a &quot;Panacea&quot;, a remedy that supposedly would cure all diseases and prolong life indefinitely. The &quot;Philosopher&apos;s stone&quot; was believed to be an essential ingredient in these goals. This mythical substance was hypothesized to have the ability to do both. A third goal of many alchemists was creating human life.

Over time, the goals of alchemy were totally reinterpreted by many readers of the subject. Many readers came to believe that these goals of alchemy were really metaphors for a spiritual transformation of the self. They then wrote manuals that reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice. For this reason, many alchemy manuals describe the &quot;Philosopher&apos;s Stone&quot; as a gift that every man potentially has unto himself, the &quot;Transmutation&quot; as the process that transform the alchemist by studying sciences, and the &quot;Panacea&quot; as the true meaning of love and science. These writers felt that when reading a book on alchemy, the reader must read &quot;over&quot; the words to figure out the way to follow   decoding the secret text to discover its true meaning. This approach remains common to adherents of Kabbalah, Jewish mysticism, who often employ gematria and notariqon to expand their understanding of their religious texts, especially the Torah.

<h1>Etymology</h1>

Wiktionary-logo-en.png 
 Look up alchemy on Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

The word alchemy comes from the Arabic al-k miya  or al-kh miya  (         or         ), which is probably formed from the article al- and the Greek word chumeia  (      ) meaning &quot;cast together&quot;, &quot;pour together&quot;, &quot;weld&quot;, &quot;alloy&quot;, etc. (from khumatos, &quot;that which is poured out, an ingot&quot;).

Some believe that the Arabic word al-k miya  means &quot;the Egyptian [science]&quot;, borrowing the Coptic word k me (or from the mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic, which wrote the word kh me), meaning &quot;Egypt&quot;. The Coptic word derives from Demotic km , itself from ancient Egyptian kmt. The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour &quot;black&quot; (Egypt was the &quot;Black land&quot;, by contrast with the &quot;Red land&quot;, the surrounding desert), so it is thought that such a borrowing in Arabic was appropriate for &quot;Egyptian black arts&quot;. However, a decree of Diocletian, written about 300 CE in Greek, speaks against &quot;the ancient writings of the Egyptians, which treat of the kh mia [transmutation] of gold and silver&quot;. The Arabic therefore could derive from a purely Greek word, not Coptic, and have been later connected with ancient Egypt through what linguists term a &quot;folk etymology.&quot;

<h1>Overview</h1>
The alchemist - by Sir William Fettes Douglas

The common perception of alchemists is that they were pseudo-scientists who attempted to turn lead into gold, believed all existence was composed of the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water, which they saw as similar in concept to the &apos;phase states&apos; of modern chemistry (rather than types of atoms, as modern science uses the word &apos;element.&apos;)

They were attempting to explore and investigate nature before the basic scientific tools and practices were available, relying instead on rules of thumb, traditions, basic observations, and mysticism to fill in the gaps. Alchemists were often involved in mysticism and magic.

To the alchemist, there was no compelling reason to separate the chemical (material) dimension from the interpretive, symbolic or philosophical one.  In those times a physics devoid of metaphysical insight would have been as partial and incomplete as a metaphysics devoid of physical manifestation. So the alchemical symbols and processes often had both an inner meaning referring to the spiritual development of the practitioner as well as a material meaning connected to physical transformation of matter. In this way his view might be said to have been something of a chemical Gestalt.

In one aspect of the alchemical world view the transmutation of base metals into gold symbolized an endeavour toward perfection or the utmost heights of actual existence. The alchemists believed that the whole universe was tending towards a state of perfection; and gold, due to its immunity to decay, was considered to be the most perfect of substances. By attempting to transmute base metals into gold, they were, in effect, trying to give the universe a helping hand. It was also logical to think that understanding the secret of gold&apos;s immutability might provide the key to ward off disease and organic decay; hence the intertwining of chemical, spiritual and astrological themes that was characteristic of medieval alchemy.

Thus, the naïve interpretations of some alchemists, or the fraudulent hopes fostered by others should not diminish the undertakings of the more sincere practitioners.  From the point of view of modern science, looking back, the field of alchemy evolved greatly over time, beginning as a practical approach to mystical discipline, maturing into a rich field of study in its own right, devolving into mysticism and outright charlatanism, and in the end providing some of the fundamental empirical knowledge of the fields of chemistry and modern medicine. The alchemists themselves suggest that the eventual development of chemistry, out of the Hermetic tradition, was a corruption of one (more base) aspect of alchemy.

Up to the 18th century, alchemy was actually considered serious science in Europe; for instance, Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his time and writing to the study of alchemy than he did to either optics or physics, for which he is famous, (see Isaac Newton&apos;s occult studies). Other eminent alchemists of the Western world are Roger Bacon, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Tycho Brahe, Thomas Browne, and Parmigianino. The decline of alchemy began in the 18th century with the birth of modern chemistry, which provided a more precise and reliable framework for matter transmutations and medicine, within a new grand design of the universe based on rational materialism.

In the first half of the nineteenth century, one established chemist, Baron Carl Reichenbach, researched on concepts similar to the old alchemy, such as the Odic force, but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion.

Matter transmutation, the old ideal of alchemy, enjoyed a moment in the sun in the 20th century when physicists were able to convert lead atoms into gold atoms via a nuclear reaction. However, the new gold atoms, being unstable isotopes, lasted for under five seconds before they broke apart.  More recently, reports of table-top element transmutation   by means of electrolysis or sonic cavitation   were the pivot of the cold fusion controversy of 1989. None of those claims have yet been reliably duplicated.

Alchemical symbolism has been occasionally used in the 20th century by psychologists and philosophers. Carl Jung reexamined alchemical symbolism and theory and began to show the inner meaning of alchemical work as a spiritual path. Alchemical philosophy, symbols and methods have enjoyed something of a renaissance in post-modern contexts, such as the New Age movement. Even some physicists have played with alchemical ideas in books such as The Tao of Physics and The Dancing Wu Li Masters.

The history of alchemy has become a vigorous academic field. As the obscure hermetic, of course language of the alchemists is gradually being &quot;deciphered&quot;, historians are becoming more  aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history, such as the Rosicrucian society and other mystic societies, witchcraft, and of course the evolution of science and philosophy.

<h1>History</h1>
Extract and symbol key from a 17th century book on alchemy. The symbols used have a one-to-one correspondence with symbols used in astrology at the time.
Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents.  These traditions&apos; general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and &quot;genetic&quot; relationships.

One can distinguish at least two major strands, which appear to be largely independent, at least in their earlier stages: Chinese alchemy, centered in Taiwan and its zone of cultural influence; and Western alchemy, whose center has shifted over the millennia between Egypt, Greece and Rome, the Islamic world, and finally back to Europe. Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism, whereas Western alchemy developed its own philosophical system, with only superficial connections to the major Western religions.  It is still an open question whether these two strands share a common origin, or to what extent they influenced each other.

<h2>Alchemy and astrology</h2>

See the main article at astrology and alchemy

Alchemy in the Western World and other locations where it was widely practiced was (and in many cases still is) closely allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian-Greek style astrology; in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for hidden knowledge.  Traditionally, each of the seven planets in the solar system as known to the ancients was associated with, held dominion over, and ruled a certain metal.

<h2>Alchemy in Ancient Egypt</h2>
The origin of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient (pharaonic) Egypt.  Metallurgy and mysticism were inexorably tied together in the ancient world, as the transformation of drab ore into shining metal must have seemed to be an act of magic governed by mysterious rules. It is claimed therefore that Alchemy in ancient Egypt was the domain of the priestly class.

Egyptian alchemy is known mostly through the writings of ancient (Hellenic) Greek philosophers, which in turn have often survived only in Islamic translations. Practically no original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived. Those writings, if they existed, were likely lost when the emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (292), which had been a center of Egyptian alchemy.

Nevertheless archaeological expeditions in recent times have unearthed evidence of chemical analysis during the Naqada periods. For example, a copper tool dating to the Naqada era bears evidence of having been used in such a way (reference: artifact 5437 on display at ).

Other evidence indicates early alchemists in ancient Egypt had invented mortar by 4000 BC and glass by 1500 BC. The chemical reaction involved in the production of Calcium Oxide is one of the oldest known (references: Calcium Oxide, limekiln):

:CaCO 3  + heat  CaO + CO 2 .

Ancient Egypt additionally produced cosmetics, cement, faience and also pitch for shipbuilding. Papyrus had also been invented by 3000 BC.

Legend has it that the founder of Egyptian alchemy was the god Thoth, called Hermes-Thoth or Thrice-Great Hermes (Hermes Trismegistus) by the Greek. According to legend, he wrote what were called the forty-two Books of Knowledge, covering all fields of knowledge   including alchemy. Hermes&apos;s symbol was the caduceus or serpent-staff, which became one of many of alchemy&apos;s principal symbols. The &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; or Hermetica of Thrice-Greatest Hermes, which is known only through Greek and Arabic translations, is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners.

The first point of the &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; tells the purpose of hermetical science: &quot;in truth certainly and without doubt, whatever is below is like that which is above, and whatever is above is like that which is below, to accomplish the miracles of one thing.&quot;   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_a  ( Burckhardt, p. 196-7 ) ]   This is the macrocosm-microcosm belief central to the hermetic philosophy.  In other words, the human body (the microcosm) is affected by the exterior world (the macrocosm), which includes the heavens through astrology, and the earth through the elements.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_b  ( Burckhardt,p. 34-42 ) ]

Following this, the Greek-speaking Macedonians conquered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria in 332.  This brought them into contact with Egyptian ideas. See Alchemy in the Greek World below.

<h2>Chinese alchemy </h2>
Whereas Western alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble ones, Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine.  The philosopher&apos;s stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists. However, in the hermetic view, these two goals were not unconnected, and the philosopher&apos;s stone was often equated with the universal panacea; therefore, the two traditions may have had more in common than it initially appears.

Black powder may have been the most important invention of Chinese alchemists. Described in 9th century texts and used in fireworks by the 10th Century, it was used in cannons by 1290. From China, the use of gunpowder spread to Japan, the Mongols, the Arab world and Europe. Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in 1241, and in Europe starting with the 14th century.

Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of medicine, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, and to martial arts such as Tai Chi Chuan and Kung Fu (although some Tai Chi schools believe that their art derives from the Hygienic or Philosophical branches of Taoism, not the Alchemical).

<h2>Indian alchemy</h2>
Little is known in the West about the character and history of Indian alchemy. An 11th century Persian alchemist named al-Biruni reported that they &quot;have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them, which is called Rasavýtam. It means the art which is restricted to certain operations, drugs, compounds, and medicines, most of which are taken from plants. Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age.&quot;  The best example of a text based on this science is The Vaishashik Darshana of Kanad (fl. 600 BC), who described an atomic theory over a century before Democritus.

The texts of Ayurvedic Medicine and Science have aspects related to alchemy, such having cures for all known diseases. The similarities in Ayurveda and alchemy are that both had methods used to treat people by putting oils over them.

Some people have also noted certain similarities between the metaphysics of the Samkhya philosophical tradition of Hinduism and the metaphysics of alchemy. Whether there is any direct connection between the two systems is an open question.

<h2>Alchemy in the Greek world</h2>
The Greek city of Alexandria in Egypt was a center of Greek alchemical knowledge, and retained its preeminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods. The Greeks appropriated the hermetical beliefs of the Egyptians and melded with them the philosophies of Pythagoreanism, ionianism, and gnosticism. Pythagorean philosophy is, essentially, the belief that numbers rule the universe, originating from the observations of sound, stars, and geometric shapes like triangles, or anything from which a ratio could be derived. Ionian thought was based on the belief that the universe could be explained through concentration on natural phenomena; this philosophy is believed to have originated with Thales and his pupil Anaximander, and later developed by Plato and Aristotle, whose works came to be an integral part of alchemy.  According to this belief, the universe can be described by a few unified natural laws that can be determined only through careful, thorough, and exacting philosophical explorations. The third component introduced to hermetical philosophy by the Greeks was gnosticism, a belief prevalent in the Christian and early post-Christian Roman empire, that the world is imperfect because it was created in a flawed manner, and that learning about the nature of spiritual matter would lead to salvation.  They further believed that God did not &quot;create&quot; the universe in the classic sense, but that the universe was created &quot;from&quot; him, but was corrupted in the process (rather than becoming corrupted by the transgressions of Adam and Eve, i.e. original sin).  According to Gnostic belief, by worshipping the cosmos, nature, or the creatures of the world, one worships the True God.  Gnostics do not seek salvation from sin, but instead seek to escape ignorance, believing that sin is merely a consequence of ignorance. Platonic and neo-Platonic theories about universals and the omnipotence of God were also absorbed.

One very important concept introduced at this time, originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle, was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements: earth, air, water, and fire. According to Aristotle, each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed.   [  #endnote_Lindsay_a  ( Lindsay, p. 16 ) ]

The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter, not quantitative, as our modern elements are. &quot;...True alchemy never regarded earth, air, water, and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present-day sense of the word. The four elements are simply the primary, and most general, qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form.&quot;   [  #endnote_Hitchcock_a  ( Hitchcock, p. 66 ) ]   Later alchemists (if Plato and Aristotle can be called alchemists) extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept.

<h2>Alchemy in the Roman Empire</h2>
The Romans adopted Greek alchemy and metaphysics, just as they adopted much of Greek knowledge and philosophy. By the end of the Roman empire the Greek alchemical philosophy had been joined to the philosophies of the Egyptians to create the cult of Hermeticism.   [  #endnote_Lindsay_b  ( Lindsay ) ]

However, the development of Christianity in the Empire brought a contrary line of thinking, stemming from Augustine (354-430 AD), an early Christian philosopher who wrote of his beliefs shortly before the fall of the Roman Empire. In essence, he felt that reason and faith could be used to understand God, but experimental philosophy was evil: &quot;There is also present in the soul, by means of these same bodily sense, a kind of empty longing and curiosity which aims not at taking pleasure in the flesh but at acquiring experience through the flesh, and this empty curiosity he is dignified by the names of learning and science.&quot;   [  #endnote_Augustine_a  ( Augustine, p. 245 ) ]

Augustinian ideas were decidedly anti-experimental, yet when Aristotelian experimental techniques were made available to the West they were not shunned.  Still, Augustinian thought was well ingrained in medieval society and was used to show alchemy as being un-Godly. Ultimately, by the high middle ages, this line of thought created a permanent rift separating alchemy from the very religion that had fostered its birth.

Much of the Roman knowledge of Alchemy, like that of the Greeks and Egyptians, is now lost. In Alexandria, the centre of alchemical studies in the Roman Empire, the art was mainly oral and in the interests of secrecy little was committed to paper. (Whence the use of &quot;hermetic&quot; to mean &quot;secretive&quot;.)   [  #endnote_Lindsay_c  ( Lindsay, p. 155 ) ]   It is possible that some writing was done in Alexandria, and that it was subsequently lost or destroyed in fires and the turbulent periods that followed.

<h2>Alchemy in the Islamic world</h2>
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the focus of alchemical development moved to the Middle East. Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented: indeed, most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Islamic translations.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_c  ( Burckhardt p. 46 ) ]

The Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy. Platonic and Aristotelian thought, which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science, continued to be assimilated.  Islamic alchemists such as al-Razi (Latin Rasis or Rhazes) contributed key chemical discoveries of their own, such as the technique of distillation (the words alembic and alcohol are of Arabic origin), the muriatic, sulfuric, and nitric acids, soda (al-natrun) and potash (alkali)   from which derive the international names of Sodium and Potassium, Natrium and Kalium   and more. The discovery that aqua regia, a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids, could dissolve the noblest metal   gold   was to fuel the imagination of alchemists for the next millennium.

Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism.  
The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir Ibn Hayyan (Arabic ,&apos;(1 %(F -J&apos;F, Latin Geberus; usually rendered in English as Geber). Jabir&apos;s ultimate goal was takwin, the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory, up to and including human life. He analyzed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness, coldness, dryness, and moistness.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_d  ( Burkhardt, p. 29 ) ]    According to Geber, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry, while gold was hot and moist.  Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_e  ( Burckhardt, p. 29 ) ]   By this reasoning, the search for the philosopher&apos;s stone was introduced to Western alchemy. Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance&apos;s name in Arabic, when treated with various transformations, held correspondences to the element&apos;s physical properties.

It is now commonly accepted that Chinese alchemy influenced Arabic alchemists   [  #endnote_Edwardes_a  ( Edwardes pp. 33-59 ) ]    [  #endnote_Burkhardt_f  ( Burckhardt, p. 10-22 ) ]  , although the extent of that influence is still a matter of debate. Likewise, Hindu learning was assimilated into Islamic alchemy, but again the extent and effects of this are not well known.

<h2>Alchemy in Medieval Europe</h2>
The Alchemist in Search of the Philosophers Stone. By Joseph Wright of Derby, 1771
Because of its strong connections to the Greek and Roman cultures, alchemy was rather easily accepted into Christian philosophy, and Medieval European alchemists extensively absorbed Islamic alchemical knowledge.  Gerbert of Aurillac, who was later to become Pope Silvester II, (d. 1003) was among the first to bring Islamic science to Europe from Spain.  Later men such as Adelard of Bath, who lived in the 12th century, brought additional learning.  But until the 13th century the moves were mainly assimilative.   [  #endnote_Hollister_a  ( Hollister p. 124, 294 ) ]

In this period there appeared some deviations from the Augustinian principles of earlier Christian thinkers. Saint Anselm (1033 1109) was an Augustinian who believed faith must precede rationalism, as Augustine and most theologians prior to Anselm had believed, but Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context.  His views set the stage for the philosophical explosion to occur. Saint Abelard followed Anselm&apos;s work, laying the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle reached the West.  His major influence on alchemy was his belief that Platonic universals did not have a separate existence outside of man&apos;s consciousness. Abelard also systematized the analysis of philosophical contradictions.   [  #endnote_Hollister_b  ( Hollister, p. 287-8 ) ]

Robert Grosseteste (1170 1253) was a pioneer of the scientific theory that would later be used and refined by the alchemists.  He took
Abelard&apos;s methods of analysis and added the use of observations, experimentation, and conclusions in making scientific evaluations. Grosseteste also did much work to bridge Platonic and Aristotelian thinking.   [  #endnote_Hollister_c  ( Hollister pp. 294-5 ) ]

Albertus Magnus (1193 1280) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 1274) were both Dominicans who studied Aristotle and worked at reconciling the differences between philosophy and Christianity.  Aquinas also did a great deal of work in developing the scientific method.  He even went as far as claiming that universals could be discovered only through logical reasoning: this ran contrary to the commonly held Platonic belief that universals were found through divine illumination alone. Magnus and Aquinas were among the first to take up the examination of alchemical theory, and could be considered to be alchemists themselves, except that these two did little in the way of experimentation.  One major contribution of Aquinas was the belief that since reason could not run in opposition to God, reason must be compatible with theology.   [  #endnote_Hollister_d  ( Hollister p. 290-4, 355 ) ]

The first true alchemist in Medieval Europe was Roger Bacon.  His work did as much for alchemy as Robert Boyle&apos;s was to do for chemistry and Galileo&apos;s for astronomy and physics. Bacon (1214 1294) was an Oxford Franciscan who explored optics and languages in addition to alchemy. The Franciscan ideals of taking on the world rather than rejecting the world led to his conviction that experimentation was more important than reasoning: &quot;Of the three ways in which men think that they acquire knowledge of things: authority, reasoning, and experience; only the last is effective and able to bring peace to the intellect.&quot; (Bacon p. 367) &quot;Experimental Science controls the conclusions of all other sciences. It reveals truths which reasoning from general principles would never have discovered.&quot;   [  #endnote_Hollister_e  ( Hollister p. 294-5 ) ]    Roger Bacon has also been attributed with originating the search for the philosopher&apos;s stone and the elixir of life: &quot;That medicine which will remove all impurities and corruptibilities from the lesser metals will also, in the opinion of the wise, take off so much of the corruptibility of the body that human life may be prolonged for many centuries.&quot; The idea of immortality was replaced with the notion of long life; after all, man&apos;s time on Earth was simply to wait and prepare for immortality in the world of God. Immortality on Earth did not mesh with Christian theology.    [  #endnote_Edwardes_b  ( Edwardes p. 37-8 ) ]

Bacon was not the only alchemist of the high middle ages, but he was the most significant. His works were used by countless alchemists of the fifteenth through nineteenth centuries. Other alchemists of Bacon&apos;s time shared several traits. First, and most obviously, nearly all were members of the clergy.  This was simply because few people outside the parochial schools had the education to examine the Arabic-derived works.  Also, alchemy at this time was sanctioned by the church as a good method of exploring and developing theology. Alchemy was interesting to the wide variety of churchmen because it offered a rationalistic view of the universe when men were just beginning to learn about rationalism.   [  #endnote_Edwardes_c  ( Edwardes p. 24-7 ) ]

So by the end of the thirteenth century, alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief. Adepts believed in the macrocosm-microcosm theories of Hermes, that is to say, they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body (e.g., if one could learn the secret of purifying gold, one could use the technique to purify the human soul.) They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above, and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated. Finally, the alchemists practiced their art: they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated. Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man&apos;s soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam.  By purifying the two parts of man&apos;s soul, man could be reunited with God.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_g  ( Burckhardt p. 149 ) ]

In the fourteenth century, these views underwent a major change. William of Ockham, an Oxford Franciscan who died in 1349, attacked the Thomist view of compatibility between faith and reason. His view, widely accepted today, was that God must be accepted on faith alone; He could not be limited by human reason. Of course this view was not incorrect if one accepted the postulate of a limitless God versus limited human reasoning capability, but it virtually erased alchemy from practice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.    [  #endnote_Hollister_f  ( Hollister p. 335 ) ]   Pope John XXII in the early 1300s issued an edict against alchemy, which effectively removed all church personnel from the practice of the Art.   [  #endnote_Edwardes_d  ( Edwardes, p.49 ) ]   The climate changes, Black plague, and increase in warfare and famine that characterized this century no doubt also served to hamper philosophical pursuits in general.

Nicholas Flamel had these mysterious alchemical symbols carved on his tomb in the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris.
Alchemy was kept alive by men such as Nicolas Flamel, who was noteworthy only because he was one of the few alchemists writing in those troubled times. Flamel lived from 1330 to 1417 and would serve as the archetype for the next phase of alchemy. He was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors, and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosopher&apos;s stone, which he is reputed to have found; his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions, but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations. Most of his work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him, especially as regarded the philosophers&apos; stone.   [  #endnote_Burkhardt_h  ( Burckhardt pp.170-181 ) ]

Through the high middle ages (1300-1500) alchemists were much like Flamel:  they concentrated on looking for the philosophers&apos; stone and the elixir of youth, now believed to be separate things.  Their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art. For example, many alchemists during this period interpreted the purification of the soul to mean the transmutation of lead into gold (in which they believed elemental mercury, or &apos;quicksilver&apos;, played a crucial role). These men were viewed as magicians and sorcerers by many, and were often persecuted for their practices.   [  #endnote_Edwardes_e  ( Edwardes pp. 50-75 ) ]    [  #endnote_Norton_a  ( Norton pp lxiii-lxvii ) ]

One of these men who emerged at the beginning of the sixteenth century was named Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. This alchemist believed himself to be a wizard and actually thought himself capable of summoning spirits.  His influence was negligible, but like Flamel, he produced writings which were referred to by alchemists of later years. Again like Flamel, he did much to change alchemy from a mystical philosophy to an occultist magic. He did keep alive the philosophies of the earlier alchemists, including experimental science, numerology, etc., but he added magic theory, which reinforced the idea of alchemy as an occultist belief.  In spite of all this, Agrippa still considered himself a Christian, though his views often came into conflict with the church.   [  #endnote_Edwardes_f  ( Edwardes p.56-9 ) ]    [  #endnote_Wilson_a  ( Wilson p.23-9 ) ]

<h2>Alchemy in the Modern Age and Renaissance</h2>
European alchemy continued in this way through the dawning of the Renaissance.  The era also saw a flourishing of con artists who would use chemical tricks and sleight of hand to &quot;demonstrate&quot; the transmutation of common metals into gold, or claim to possess secret knowledge that   with a &quot;small&quot; initial investment   would surely lead to that goal.

The most important name in this period is Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus, (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, 1493 1541) who cast alchemy into a new form, rejecting some of the occultism that had accumulated over the years and promoting the use of observations and experiments to learn about the human body. He rejected Gnostic traditions, but kept much of the Hermetical, neo-Platonic, and Pythagorean philosophies; however, Hermetical science had so much Aristotelian theory that his rejection of Gnosticism was practically meaningless. In particular, Paracelsus rejected the magic theories of Agrippa and Flamel. He did not think of himself as a magician, and scorned those who did. (Williams p.239-45)

Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine, and wrote &quot;Many have said of Alchemy, that it is for the making of gold and silver. For me such is not the aim, but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines.&quot;   [  #endnote_Edwardes_g  ( Edwardes, p.47 ) ]   His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm. He took an approach different from those before him, using this analogy not in the manner of soul-purification  but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies, and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them.   [  #endnote_Debus_a  ( Debus &amp; Multhauf, p.6-12 ) ]   While his attempts of treating diseases with such remedies as Mercury might seem ill-advised from a modern point of view, his basic idea of chemically produced medicines has stood time surprisingly well.

&quot;Alchemik Michał Sędziwój&quot;, oil on board by Jan Matejko, 73 x 130 cm, Museum of Arts in Aódz.
In England, the topic of alchemy in that time frame is often associated  with Doctor John Dee (July 13 1527   December, 1608), better known for his role as astrologer, cryptographer, and general &quot;scientific consultant&quot; to Queen Elizabeth I. Dee was considered an authority on the works of Roger Bacon, and was interested enough in alchemy to write a book on that subject (Monas Hieroglyphica, 1564) influenced by the Kabbala. Dee&apos;s associate Edward Kelley   who claimed to converse with angels through a crystal ball and to own a powder that would turn mercury into gold   may have been the source of the popular image of the alchemist-charlatan.

Another lesser known alchemist was Michał Sędziwój (Michael Sendivogius, 1566 - 1636), a Polish alchemist, philosopher, medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry. According to some accounts, he distilled oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600, 170 years before Scheele and Priestley, by warming nitre (saltpetre). He thought of the gas given off as &quot;the elixir of life&quot;. It is possible that Sendivogious wasn&apos;t actually the first to accomplish this task. Distilled oxygen seems to satisfy the riddle, &quot;It was carried in the womb by the wind&quot;, from the ancient egyptian Emerald Tablet. This suggests that oxygen may have been distilled by alchemists in ancient egypt. Shortly after discovering this method, it is believed that Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel. In 1621, Drebbel practically applied this in a submarine.

Tycho Brahe (1546 1601), better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations, was also an alchemist. He had a laboratory built for that purpose at his Uraniborg observatory/research institute.

<h2>The decline of Western alchemy</h2>
The demise of Western alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for &quot;ancient wisdom&quot;. Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century, alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years, and in fact may have reached its apogee in the 18th century.

Robert Boyle (1627 1691), better known for his studies of gases (cf. Boyle&apos;s law) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations. He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data; in a typical experiment, Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out, the wind characteristics, the position of the sun and moon, and the barometer reading, all just in case they proved to be relevant.    [  #endnote_Pilkington_a  ( Pilkington p.11 ) ]   This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on revolutionary discoveries of Lavoisier and John Dalton   which finally provided a logical, quantitative and reliable framework for understanding matter transmutations, and revealed the futility of longstanding alchemical goals such as the philospher&apos;s stone.

Meanwhile, Paracelsian alchemy led to the development of modern medicine.  Experimentalists gradually uncovered the workings of the human body, such as blood circulation (Harvey, 1616), and eventually traced many diseases to infections with germs (Koch and Pasteur, 19th century) or lack of natural nutrients and vitamins (Lind, Eijkman, Funk, et al.). Supported by parallel developments in organic chemistry, the new science easily displaced alchemy from its medical roles, interpretive and prescriptive, while deflating its hopes of miraculous elixirs and exposing the ineffectiveness or even toxicity of its remedies.

Thus, as science steadily continued to uncover and rationalize the clockwork of the universe, founded on its own materialistic metaphysics, Alchemy was left deprived of its chemical and medical connections   but still incurably burdened by them.  Reduced to an arcane philosophical system, poorly connected to the material world, it suffered the common fate of other esoteric disciplines such as astrology and Kabbalah: excluded from university curricula, shunned by its former patrons, ostracized by scientists, and commonly viewed as the epitome of charlatanism and superstition.

These developments could be interpreted as part of a broader reaction in European intellectualism against the Romantic movement of the preceding century. Be as it may, it is sobering to observe how a discipline that held so much intellectual and material prestige, for more than two thousand years, could disappear so easily from the universe of Western thought.

<h2>Modern &apos;alchemy&apos;</h2>

In modern times, progress has been made toward achieving the goals of alchemy using scientific, rather than alchemic, means. Alchemists themselves have referred to this type of approach as &apos;alchemy&apos;.

In 1919, Ernest Rutherford used artificial disintegration to convert nitrogen into oxygen. This process of bombarding the atomic nucleus with high energy particles is the principle behind modern particle accelerators, in which transmutations of elements are common. Indeed, in 1980, Glenn Seaborg transmuted lead into gold, though the amount of energy used and the microscopic quantities created negated any possible financial benefit. (Focus Magazine. #155.  Oct 2005)

On June 21, 1964,  Dr. George Ohsawa and Dr. Michio Kushi, based on Dr. Louis Kervran&apos;s works Transmutations A Faible Energie, reportedly successfully transmutated sodium into potassium, by use of an electric arc.  Kervran&apos;s formula was

{}^{23}Na+{}^{16}O \longrightarrow {}^{39}K .

Ohsawa and Kushi then focused on transmutation of carbon and oxygen into steel according to the formula:  2(^{12}C + ^{16}O)\longrightarrow2^{28}Si\longrightarrow^{56}Ni\longrightarrow^{56}Fe  In 1994, R. Sundaresan and J.Bockris (Texas A&amp;M) reported that they had observed &quot;Anomalous Reactions During Arcing Between Carbon Rods In Water&quot; possibly confirming previous experiments (Fusion Technology, Vol 26, Pg 261, November 1994).

As of 2005, a universal panacea remains elusive, though futurists such as Ray Kurzweil believe sufficiently advanced nanotechnology may prolong life indefinitely. Some say the third goal of alchemy has been fulfilled by IVF and the cloning of a human embryo, although these technologies fall far short of creating a human life from scratch.

The aim of artificial intelligence research could be said to be creating a life from scratch, and those philosophically opposed to the possibility of AI have compared it with alchemy, such as Herbert and Stuart Dreyfus in their 1960 paper Alchemy and AI.

<h2>Alchemy in literature</h2>
Many authors lampooned alchemists and used them as the butt of satirical attacks.  Two famous examples of these include the play The Alchemist by Ben Jonson and, two hundred years earlier, Geoffrey Chaucer&apos;s literary work Canon&apos;s Yeoman&apos;s Tale. Some others noteworthy examples include:

*In the Harry Potter children&apos;s books and movies, a Philosopher&apos;s stone (in the American edition, titled a &quot;sorcerer&apos;s stone&quot;) is mentioned. This stone was created by alchemists within the world created by J.K. Rowling. This stone could turn any metal into pure gold, and created an &quot;Elixir of Life&quot; that enabled the drinker to live much longer than usual. The alchemist Nicholas Flamel also appears in the novel, and he is given credit for creating the Stone. In the story, to remain immune to natural death, one must have a constant supply of this elixir.

*An alchemist named Melquíades is a character in Gabriel García Márquez&apos;s classic novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. The alchemical motifs add a magical sense to the novel (see magical realism).

*In the second part of Faust, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe portrays Faust&apos;s servant Wagner using alchemy to create a homunculus.

*Doctor Illuminatus, The Alchemist&apos;s Son by Martin Booth speaks about alchemy and a homunculus.

*Alchemy, the Philosopher&apos;s Stone, homunculi, and numerous alchemical symbols (including Flamel&apos;s crucified serpent) play key roles in the anime/manga series Fullmetal Alchemist (Hagane no Renkinjutsushi).  Other anime/manga series following Hagane no Renkinjutsushi, such as Busou Renkin, also include alchemy references.

*The Fantastic Four villain Diablo is an alchemist.  He uses his alchemical skills to concoct bizarre potions, slow down his aging, and, in a memorable story arc, he once temporarily cured The Thing of his lamentable mutation.

*The plot of the book The Geographer&apos;s Library by John Fasman revolves around thirteen alchemical artifacts.

*In Mary Shelly&apos;s Frankenstein, Victor Frankenstein becomes enraptured in alchemy as a boy. Employing both alchemy and modern science, he creates the monster many refer to as Frankenstein&apos;s monster.

*The ways and methods of Alchemy were also essential to Paulo Coelho&apos;s novel, The Alchemist.

*The term &apos;alchemical&apos; is sometimes used to refer to a study that is stumbling toward becoming science but has not reached that state yet. For instance, Larry Niven in his Known Space stories describes twentieth century psychology as being &apos;in its alchemical stages&apos;, before it is perfected by later generations into a true science.

*Margaret Mahy wrote a book called Alchemy, where a boy has to spy on a mysterious girl in his class who is studying alchemy, but a wizard from the boy&apos;s past wants the girl&apos;s power and is using the boy for information.

*The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson features considerable sections concerning alchemy, with protagonistas including Isaac Newton, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier and sundry other Europeans of note during late 17th and early 18th centuries. The principal Alchemist of the tale is the mysterious Enoch Root who also features in the contempory novel Cryptonomicon.

*Newton and de Duillier, among others, are also important characters in Gregory Keyes&apos;s Age of Unreason series of novels.

Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (also called ADS-B) is a system by which airplanes constantly broadcast their current position and altitude, category of aircraft, airspeed, identification, and whether the aircraft is turning, climbing or descending over a dedicated radio datalink. This functionality is known as &quot;ADS-B out&quot; and is the basic level of ADS-B functionality.

The ADS-B system was developed in the 1990s.  It relies on data from the Global Positioning System, or any navigation system that provides an equivalent or better service. The maximum range of the system is line-of-sight, typically less than 200 nautical miles (370 km).

The ADS-B transmissions are received by air traffic control stations, and all other ADS-B equipped aircraft within reception range. Reception by aircraft of ADS-B data is known as &quot;ADS-B in&quot;.

The initial use of ADS-B is expected to be by air traffic control and for surveillance purposes and for enhancing pilot situational awareness. ADS-B is lower cost than conventional radar and permits higher quality surveillance of airborne and surface movements.  ADS-B is effective in remote areas or in mountainous terrain where there is no radar coverage, or where radar coverage is limited. The outback of Australia is one such area where ADS-B will provide surveillance where previously none existed. ADS-B also enhances surveillance on the airport surface, so it can also be used to monitor traffic on the taxiways and runways of an airport.

ADS-B equipped aircraft may also have a display unit in the cockpit picturing surrounding air traffic from ADS-B data (ADS-B in) and TIS-B (Traffic Information Service-Broadcast) data derived from air traffic radar. Both Pilots and air traffic controllers will then be able to &quot;see&quot; the positions of air traffic in the vicinity of the aircraft, and this may be used to provide an ASAS (Airborne Separation Assurance System).

Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems may also make use of &quot;ADS-B in&quot;, supplementing the existing TCAS collision avoidance system.

Airbus and Boeing are now expected to include ADS-B out (i.e. the transmitter of information) as standard on new-build aircraft from 2005 onwards. This is in part due to the European requirements for Mode S Elementary Surveillance (which uses 1090MHz Extended Squitter), and some common functionality with ADS-B out.

The currently (2005) used data links for ADS-B are: (i) 1090 MHz (the same frequency the transponder replies to secondary surveillance radar interrogations), (ii) 978 MHz (Universal Access Transceiver), and (iii) VHF Digital link mode -4 (VDL Mode 4). 1090 MHz Extended Squitter is the globally agreed standard for ADS-B for air carrier aircraft with existing Mode S transponders. The 1090ES has limited capacity and is, therefore, limited to supporting just ADS-B. The UAT has been used operationally in the United States since 1999 and supports air traffic separation services in Alaska. The UAT provides significant communications bandwidth and in addition to ADS-B, provides no-fee traffic (TIS-B) and weather (FIS-B) uplink services (see FAA&apos;s Safe Flight 21 link below). The VDL-4 has been used in several demonstration programs throughout Europe.

<h1> Projects and Trials </h1>
The FAA has been developing ADS-B since the early 1990s and has transitioned its demonstration programs into operational systems. 
*	Safe Flight 21/Capstone: 1999 – 2002, followed by Capstone II 2003 – 2006
*       Safe Flight 21 East Coast Deployment of Broadcast Services 2003 - present

ADS-B initial projects and trials in Europe first started around 1995. Standardisation activities started at a similar time and have grown in intensity since. Both areas are now seeing a significant amount of work.

It is expected that implementations of pre-operational and then operational systems will occur in future years (for example, the SEAP project – South European ADS-B Project – and NUP II project are both looking at pre-operational trials in 2005).

Dates of some example ADS-B projects and trials/evaluations are:

*	NEAN: January 1996 – December 1999
*       OpEval-1 (Operational Evaluation-1 at Wilmington, Ohio) - July 1999
*	NEAP: September 1997 – September 1998
*       OpEval-2 (Louisville, Kentucky) - October 2000
*	NUP and NUP II: 1998 – 2002, followed by NUP II and soon NUP II+
*       TESIS (Test and Evaluation of Surveillance Information System) Memphis, Tennessee, July 2002
*	ADS-MEDUP: 2000 – 2004
*	FARAWAY: 1996 – mid 1998, followed by FARAWAY II: June 1998 – 2000 
*	Eurocontrol ADS Programme: 1997 - 2004 
*	Eurocontrol CASCADE Programme: 2004 - present

The Republic of Austria (German: Republik Österreich) is a landlocked country in central Europe. It borders Germany and the Czech Republic to the north, Slovakia and Hungary to the east, Slovenia and Italy to the south, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the west.  The capital is the city of Vienna.

Austria is a parliamentary representative democracy consisting of nine federal states and is one of two European countries that have declared their everlasting neutrality, the other being Switzerland. Austria is a member of United Nations and the European Union.

<h1> Origin and history of the name </h1>

The German name Österreich can be translated into English as the &quot;eastern realm&quot;, which is derived from the Old German Ostarrîchi. &quot;Reich&quot; can also mean &quot;empire,&quot; and this connotation is the one that is understood in the context of the Austrian/Austro-Hungarian Empire, German Empire, &quot;Third Reich,&quot; or Holy Roman Empire, although not in the context of the modern Republic of &quot;Österreich.&quot; The term probably originates in a vernacular translation of the Medieval Latin name for the region: Marchia orientalis, which translates as &quot;eastern border,&quot; as it was situated at the eastern edge of the Holy Roman Empire, that was also mirrored in the name Ostmark applied after Anschluss to the Third Reich.

<h1> History </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see History of Austria.

<h2> Austria and the Holy Roman Empire </h2>

The territory of Austria, by then the Celtic kingdom of Noricum, which was a long time ally of Rome, (cattle and early steel) and rather occupied than conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus and made the province Noricum  in 16 BC. Later it was conquered by Huns, Rugii,  Lombards, Ostrogoths, Bavarii, Avars (till about 800),  and Franks (in that order). Finally, after  50 years of Hungarian rule (907 to 955), the core territory of Austria was awarded to  Leopold of Babenberg in 976. Being part of the Holy Roman Empire the Babenbergs ruled and expanded Austria from the 10th century to the 13th century.

Battle of Vienna 1683

After Duke Frederick II died in 1246 and left no successor, the German King Rudolf I of Habsburg gave the lands to his sons marking the beginning of the line of the Habsburgs, who continued to govern Austria until the 20th century.

With the short exception of Charles VII Albert of Bavaria, Austrian Habsburgs held the position of German Emperor beginning in 1438 with Albert II of Habsburg until the end of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 14th and 15th century Austria continued to expand its territory until it reached the position of a European superpower at the end of the 15th century until the end of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918.

<h2> Modern history </h2>

After the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Empire of Austria was founded, which was transformed in 1867 into the double-monarchy Austria-Hungary. The empire was split into several independent states in 1918, after the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, with most of the German-speaking parts becoming a republic. (See Treaty of Saint-Germain.) Between 1918 and 1919 it was officially known as the Republic of German Austria (Republik Deutschösterreich). After the Entente powers forbade German Austria to unite with Germany, they also forbade the name, and then it was changed to simply Republic of Austria. The democratic republic lasted until 1933 when the chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß established an autocratic regime oriented towards Italian fascism (Austrofascism).

Austria became part of Germany in 1938 (the Anschluß) amidst popular acclaim. After the defeat of the Axis Powers, the Allies occupied Austria at the end of World War II in Europe until 1955, when the country again became a fully independent republic under the condition that it remained neutral (see also: Austrian State Treaty). In that year it also became a member of the UN.  After the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, Austria became increasingly involved in European affairs, and in 1995, Austria joined the European Union, and the Euro monetary system in 1999.

<h1> Politics </h1>

Austrian Parliament

Austria has been a federal, parliamentary democracy republic since the Federal Constitution of 1920, which was again reintroduced in 1945 to the nine states of the Federal Republic. The head of state is the Federal President, who is directly elected. The chairman of the Federal Government is the Federal Chancellor, who is appointed by the president and voted into office by the majority of the Nationalrat, the National Council of Austria. The government can be recalled by a vote of no confidence in the National Council.

The Austrian parliament consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat is determined every four years by a free general election in which every citizen is allowed to vote to fill its 183 seats. A &quot;Four Percent Hurdle&quot; prevents a large splintering of the political landscape in the Nationalrat by awarding seats only to political parties that have received at least four percent of the general vote, or alternatively, have won a direct seat, or Direktmandat, in one of the 43 regional election districts. The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can pass the respective bill a second time bypassing the Bundesrat altogether). A convention, called the Österreich Konvent  was convened in June 30, 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution.

<h1> Subdivisions </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see States of Austria.

A federal republic, Austria is divided into nine states, (German: Bundesländer). These states are divided into districts (Bezirke) and cities (Statutarstädte).  Districts are subdivided into municipalities (Gemeinden). Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions, but have some distinct legislative authority separate from the federal government.

<h1> Geography </h1>

Map of Austria
Topography of Austria

Austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the Alps. The Central Eastern Alps, Northern Limestone Alps and Southern Limestone Alps are all partly in Austria.  Of the total area of Austria (84,000 km²), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below 500 metres.  The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country.

Austria may be divided into 5 different areas.  The biggest area are the Austrian Alps, which constitute 62% of Austria&apos;s total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the Carpathians account for around 12% of its area.  The foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north.  Known as the Austrian granite plateau, it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass, and accounts for 10% of Austria.  The Austrian portion of the Viennese basin comprises the remaining 4%.

<h2>Climate</h2>
The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate climate zone in which humid westerly winds predominate. With over half of the country dominated by the Alps the alpine climate is the predominate one. In the East the climate shows continental features with less rain than the Western alpine areas with high rainfall averages.

The six highest mountains in Austria are:

<h1> Economy </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see Economy of Austria. 
 The Belvedere Palace, an example of the Baroque

Austria has a well-developed social market economy and a high standard of living. Until the 1980s many of Austria&apos;s largest industry firms were nationalised, however in recent years privatisation has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. Labour movements are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics.

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the German economy. Slow growth in Germany and elsewhere in the world affected Austria, slowing its growth to 1.2% in 2001. But since Austria became a member state of the European Union it has gained closer ties to other European Union economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria&apos;s access to the single European market and proximity to EU aspiring economies. Therefore estimates of growth in 2005 (up to 2%) are much more favourable than in the crippling German economy.

Agriculture: Austrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive.

Industry:  Although some industries, such as several iron and steel works and chemical plants, are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.

Services: Like in other western countries, the biggest contributor to Austria&apos;s GDP is its service sector. Most notably is tourism, especially winter tourism.

To meet increased competition from both EU and Central European countries, Austria will need to emphasize knowledge-based sectors of the economy, continue to deregulate the service sector, and lower its tax burden.

<h1> Demographics </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see Demographics of Austria. 
Vienna during the first half of the 18th century, painting by Canaletto

Austria&apos;s capital Vienna is one of Europe&apos;s major cities with a population exceeding 1.6 million (2 million with suburbs) and constitutes a melting pot of citizens from all over Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to this Metropolis, other cities do not exceed 1 million inhabitants, in fact the second largest city Graz is home of 305,000 people (followed by Linz with 180,000, Salzburg with 145,000 and Innsbruck with 120,000). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

Austrians of German mother tongue, by far the country&apos;s largest ethnic group, form between 85% and 89% of Austria&apos;s population. Around ten percent of Austria&apos;s people are of non-Austrian descent, many from surrounding countries, especially from the former East Bloc nations. The Austrian federal states of Carinthia and Styria are home to a significant (indigenous) Slovenian minority with around 14,000 members (Austrian census; unofficial numbers of Slovene groups speak of about 40,000). So-called guest workers (Gastarbeiter) and their descendants also form an important minority group in Austria. Around 20,000 Hungarians and 30.000 Croatians live in the east-most Bundesland, Burgenland (formerly part of Hungary).

The official language, German, is spoken by almost all residents of the country. Austria&apos;s mountainous terrain led to the development of many distinct German dialects. All of the dialects in the country, however, belong to Austro-Bavarian groups of German dialects, with the exception of the dialect spoken in its west-most Bundesland, Vorarlberg, which belongs to the group of Alemannic dialects.
There is also a distinct grammatical standard for Austrian German with a few differences to the German spoken in Germany.

<h2> Politics concerning ethnic groups (Volksgruppenpolitik) in Austria </h2>

An estimated 25,000-40,000 Slovenians in the Austrian state of Carinthia as well as Croatians and Hungarians in Burgenland were recognized as a minority and have enjoyed special rights following the Austrian State Treaty (Staatsvertrag) of 1955. The Slovenians in the Austrian state of Styria (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognized as a minority and do not enjoy special rights, although the State Treaty of July 27, 1955 states otherwise.
The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene and Croatian speaking Austrians live alongside with the German speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented. There is also an undercurrent of thinking amongst parts of the Carenthian population that the Slovenian involvement in the partisan war against the Nazi occupation force was a bad thing, and indeed &quot;Tito partisan&quot; is a not an infrequent insult hurled against members of the minority. Many Carinthians are afraid of Slovenian territorial claims, pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two World Wars. The current governor, Jörg Haider, regularly plays the Slovenian card when his popularity starts to dwindle, and indeed relies on the strong anti-Slovenian attitudes in many parts of the province for his power base. However, a recent poll suggests that a 2/3 majority of Carinthians are in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs in order to fulfil the requirements set by the State Treaty. Another interesting phenomenon is the so called &quot;Windischen-Theorie&quot;  stating that the Slovenians can be split in two groups: actual Slovenians and Windische, based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenians, who were taught Slovenian standard language in school and those Slovenians, who spoke their local Slovenian dialect but went to German schools. To the latter group the term &quot;Windische&quot; (originally the German word for Slovenians) was applied, claiming that they were a different ethnic group. This theory was never generally accepted and has been ultimately rejected several decades ago.

<h1> Religion </h1>

Charles V Austrian Habsburg ruler and one of the major figures within the Counter-Reformation

While northern and central Germany was the origin of the Reformation, Austria (and Bavaria) were the heart of the Counter-Reformation in the 16th and 17th century, when the absolute monarchy of Habsburg imposed a strict regime to maintain Catholicism&apos;s power and influence among Austrians. Despite this establishment of Catholicism as the predominant Christian religion (Protestants have throughout Austria&apos;s history remained a relatively small group), Austria&apos;s history as a multinational state has made it necessary for Habsburg rulers to deal with a heterogeneous religious population. Religious freedom was declared a constitutional right as early as 1867 and Austria-Hungary was home of numerous religions beside Roman Catholicism such as Greek, Serbian, Romanian, Russian, and Bulgarian Orthodox Christians, Jews,  Muslims (Austria neighboured the Turkish empire for centuries), Mormons and both Calvinists and Lutheran Protestants.

Still Austria remained largely influenced by Catholicism. After 1918 First Republic Catholic leaders such as Theodor Innitzer and Ignaz Seipel took leading positions within or close to the Austrian Government and increased their influence during the time of the Austrofascism – Catholicism was treated much like a state religion by dictators Engelbert Dollfuss and Kurt Schuschnigg. Although Catholic leaders welcomed the Germans in 1938 during the Anschluss of Austria into Hitlerite Germany, Austrian Catholicism stopped its support of Nazism later on and many former Religious public figures became involved with the resistance during the Third Reich. After 1945 a stricter secularism was imposed in Austria and religious influence on politics has nearly vanished.

As of the end of the 20th century about 73% of Austria&apos;s population are registered as Roman Catholic, while about 5% consider themselves Protestants. Both these numbers have been on the decline for decades, especially Roman Catholicm has suffered an increasing number of seceders of the church. This is due partly to sexual abuse scandals of children by priests as well as the alleged unwillingness of the Roman Catholic Church to implement reforms. In addition Austrians Catholics are obliged to pay a mandatory tax (calculated by income – ca 1%) to the Austrian Roman Catholic Church, which acts as another incentive to leave the church.

About 12% of the population declare that they do not belong to any church or religious community. Of the remaining people, about 180,000 are members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and about 7,300 are Jewish. It has to be noted that the Austrian Jewish Community of 1938 – Vienna alone counted more than 200,000, of which solely 4,000 to 5,000 remained after the Second World War. The influx of Eastern Europeans, especially from the former Yugoslav nations, Albania and particularly from Turkey largely contributed to a substantial Muslim minority in Austria – around 300,000 are registered as members of various Muslim communities. The numbers of people adhering to the Islam has increased largely during the last years and is expected to grow in the future. Buddhism, which was legally recognized as a religion in Austria in 1983, enjoys widespread acceptance and has a following of 20,000 (10,402 at the 2001 census).

A 2005 survey among 8,000 people in various European countries showed that Austrians are still among the countries with the strongest belief in God. 84% of all Austrians do state they believe in God, with only Poland (97%), Portugal (90%) and Russia (87%) in front of the countries surveyed. This is a much larger figure than the European average of 71% or Germany with 67%.

<h1> Culture </h1>
:For more details on this topic, see Culture of Austria.

Ludwig Wittgenstein

Although Austria is a small country, its history as a world power and its unique cultural environment in the heart of Europe have generated contributions to mankind in every possible field. Austria is presumably internationally best known for its musicians. It has been the birthplace of many famous composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert, Anton Bruckner, Johann Strauss, Sr., Johann Strauss, Jr. or Gustav Mahler as well as members of the Second Viennese School such as Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern or Alban Berg.

Complementing its status as a land of artists, Austria has always been a country of great poets, writers and novelists. It was the home of novelists Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig, Thomas Bernhard or Robert Musil, of poets Georg Trakl, Franz Werfel, Franz Grillparzer, Rainer Maria Rilke or Adalbert Stifter. Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are Elfriede Jelinek and Peter Handke. Among Austrian artists and architects one can find painters Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele or Friedensreich Hundertwasser,  photographer Inge Morath or architect Otto Wagner.

Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists including physicists Ludwig Boltzmann, Lise Meitner, Erwin Schrödinger, Ernst Mach, Wolfgang Pauli, Richard von Mises and Christian Doppler, philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper, biologists Gregor Mendel and Konrad Lorenz as well as mathematician Kurt Gödel. It was home to psychologists Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Paul Watzlawick and Hans Asperger, psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, economists Joseph Schumpeter, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek (Austrian School), and engineers such as Ferdinand Porsche and Siegfried Marcus.

Although Austrians can look back with pride on their cultural past, current Austria does not stand back in art and science. Austria hosts a tremendous amount of culture, with its classical music festivals in Vienna, Salzburg and Bregenz, its modern artists and writers, its theatres and opera houses.

The Commonwealth of Australia is a country in the Southern Hemisphere comprising the world&apos;s smallest continent and a number of islands in the Southern, Indian and Pacific Oceans. Australia&apos;s neighbouring countries are Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia to the north-east, and New Zealand to the south-east.

The continent of Australia has been inhabited for over 40,000 years by Indigenous Australians. After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by European explorers and merchants starting in the 17th century, the eastern half of the continent was claimed by the British in 1770 and officially settled as the penal colony of New South Wales on January 26 1788. As the population grew and new areas were explored, another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were successively established over the course of the 19th century.

On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated and the Commonwealth of Australia was formed. Since federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system and remains a Commonwealth Realm. The current population of around 20.4 million is concentrated mainly in the large coastal cities of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.

<h1> Origin and history of the name </h1>

The name Australia is derived from the Latin australis, meaning southern. Legends of an &quot;unknown southern land&quot; (terra australis incognita) date back to the Roman times and were commonplace in mediæval geography, but they were not based on any actual knowledge of the continent. The Dutch adjectival form Australische (&quot;Australian,&quot; in the sense of &quot;southern&quot;) was used by Dutch officials in Batavia to refer to the newly discovered land to the south as early as 1638. The first English language writer to use the word &quot;Australia&quot; was Alexander Dalrymple in An Historical Collection of Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, published in 1771. He used the term to refer to the entire South Pacific region, not specifically to the Australian continent. In 1793, George Shaw and Sir James Smith published Zoology and Botany of New Holland, in which they wrote of &quot;the vast island, or rather continent, of Australia, Australasia or New Holland.&quot;
View of Port Jackson, taken from the South Head, from A Voyage to Terra Australis. Sydney was established on this site.
The name &quot;Australia&quot; was popularised by the 1814 work A Voyage to Terra Australis by the navigator Matthew Flinders. Despite its title, which reflected the view of the Admiralty, Flinders used the word &quot;Australia&quot; in the book, which was widely read and gave the term general currency. Governor Lachlan Macquarie of New South Wales subsequently used the word in his dispatches to England. In 1817 he recommended that it be officially adopted. In 1824, the British Admiralty finally accepted that the continent should be known officially as Australia.

The word &quot;Australia&quot; in Australian English is pronounced  /ə.ˈstɹæɪ.ljə/ ,  /ə.ˈstɹæɪ.liː.ə/  or  /ə.ˈstɹæɪ.jə/ .

<h1> History </h1>
:Main article: History of Australia 
Lieutenant James Cook charted the East coast of Australia on HM Bark Endeavour, claiming the land for Britain in 1770. This replica was built in Fremantle in 1988 for Australia&apos;s bicentenary.
The first human habitation of Australia is estimated to have occurred between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago.    1     The first Australians were the ancestors of the current Indigenous Australians; they arrived via land bridges and short sea-crossings from present-day Southeast Asia. Most of these people were hunter-gatherers, with a complex oral culture and spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime. The Torres Strait Islanders, ethnically Melanesian, inhabited the Torres Strait Islands and parts of far-north Queensland; they possess distinct cultural practices and practised subsistence agriculture.

The first undisputed recorded European sighting of the Australian continent was made by the Dutch navigator Willem Jansz, who sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in 1606. During the 17th century, the Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines of what they called New Holland, but made no attempt at settlement. In 1770, James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast of Australia, which he named New South Wales and claimed for Britain. The expedition&apos;s discoveries provided impetus for the establishment of a penal colony there following the loss of the American colonies that had previously filled that role.

Port Arthur, Tasmania was Australia&apos;s largest penal colony.
The British Crown Colony of New South Wales started with the establishment of a settlement at Port Jackson by Captain Arthur Phillip on January 26 1788. This date was later to become Australia&apos;s national day, Australia Day. Van Diemen&apos;s Land, now known as Tasmania, was settled in 1803 and became a separate colony in 1825. Britain formally claimed the western part of Australia in 1829. Separate colonies were created from parts of New South Wales: South Australia in 1836, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859. The Northern Territory (NT) was founded in 1863 as part of the Province of South Australia. Victoria and South Australia were founded as &quot;free colonies&quot;—that is, they were never penal colonies, although the former did receive some convicts from Tasmania. Western Australia was also founded &quot;free&quot;, but later accepted transported convicts due to an acute labour shortage. The transportation of convicts to Australia was phased out between 1840 and 1868.

The Indigenous Australian population, estimated at about 350,000 at the time of European settlement,    2     declined steeply for 150 years following settlement, mainly because of infectious disease, and forced migration, the removal of children and other colonial government policies that by today&apos;s understanding could be considered to constitute genocide.    3     Following the 1967 referendum, the Federal government gained the power to implement policies and make laws with respect to Aborigines. Traditional ownership of land—native title—was not recognised until the High Court case Mabo v Queensland (No 2) overturned the notion of Australia as terra nullius at the time of European occupation.

The Last Post is played at an ANZAC Day ceremony in Port Melbourne, Victoria, April 25 2005. Ceremonies such as this are held in virtually every suburb and town in Australia. 
A gold rush began in Australia in the early 1850s, and the Eureka Stockade rebellion in 1854 was an early expression of nationalist sentiment. Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire. The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs, defence and international shipping. On 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, consultation and voting, and the Commonwealth of Australia was born, as a Dominion of the British Empire. The Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of Canberra (Melbourne was the capital from 1901 to 1927). The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911. Australia willingly participated in World War I;    4     many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli as the birth of the nation—its first major military action.  Much like Gallipoli the Kokoda Track Campaign is regarded by many as a nation defining battle from World War II.

The Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and Britain, but Australia did not adopt the Statute until 1942. The shock of Britain&apos;s defeat in Asia in 1942 and the threat of Japanese invasion caused Australia to turn to the United States as a new ally and protector. Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the US under the auspices of the ANZUS treaty. After World War II, Australia encouraged mass immigration from Europe, and since the 1970s and the abolition of the White Australia policy from Asia and other parts of the world; radically transforming Australia&apos;s demography, culture and image of itself. The final constitutional ties between Australia and Britain ended in 1986 with the passing of the Australia Act 1986, ending any British role in the Australian States, and ending judicial appeals to the UK Privy Council. Although Australian voters rejected a move to become a republic in 1999 by a 55% majority,    5     Australia&apos;s links to its British past are increasingly tenuous. Since the election of the Whitlam Government in 1972, there has been an increasing focus on the nation&apos;s future as a part of the Asia-Pacific region.

<h1>Politics</h1>
New Parliament House in Canberra was opened in 1988 replacing the provisional Parliament House building opened in 1927.
 See main articles: Government of Australia, Politics of Australia

The Commonwealth of Australia is a constitutional monarchy and has a parliamentary system of government. Queen Elizabeth II is the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The Queen is nominally represented by the Governor-General; although the Constitution gives extensive executive powers to the Governor-General, these are normally exercised only on the advice of the Prime Minister. The most notable exercise of the Governor-General&apos;s reserve powers outside the Prime Minister&apos;s direction was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.    6 

There are three branches of government.
*The legislature: the Commonwealth Parliament, comprising the Queen, the Senate, and the House of Representatives; the Queen is represented by the Governor-General, who in practice exercises little or no power over the Parliament.
*The executive: the Federal Executive Council (the Governor-General as advised by the executive councillors); in practice, the councillors are the prime minister and ministers of state, whose advice the Governor-General accepts, with rare exceptions.
*The judiciary: the High Court of Australia and other federal courts. The State courts became formally independent from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council when the Australia Act was passed in 1986.

The bicameral Commonwealth Parliament consists of the Queen, the Senate (the upper house) of 76 senators, and a House of Representatives (the lower house) of 150 members. Members of the lower house are elected from single-member constituencies, commonly known as &apos;electorates&apos; or &apos;seats&apos;. Seats in the House of Representatives are allocated to states on the basis of population. In the Senate, each state, regardless of population, is represented by 12 senators, with the ACT and the NT each electing two. Elections for both chambers are held every three years; typically only half of the Senate seats are put to each election, because senators have overlapping six-year terms.  The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms Government, with its leader becoming Prime Minister.

There are three major political parties: the Labor Party, the Liberal Party and the National Party. Independent members and several minor parties—including the Greens, Family First and the Australian Democrats—have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses, although their influence has been marginal. Since the 1996 election, the Liberal/National Coalition led by the Prime Minister, John Howard, has been in power in Canberra. In the 2004 election, the Coalition won control of the Senate, the first time that a party has done so while in government in more than 30 years. The Labor Party is in power in every state and territory.  Voting is compulsory in each state and territory and at the federal level.

<h1> States and territories</h1>
:Main article: Australian states and territories 
States and territories of Australia

Australia consists of six states and several territories. The states are New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The two mainland territories are the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT); the federal government administers a separate area within New South Wales, the Jervis Bay Territory, as a naval base and sea port for the national capital.

In most respects, the territories function similarly to the states, but the Commonwealth Parliament can override any legislation of their parliaments. By contrast, federal legislation overrides state legislation only with respect to certain areas as set out in Section 51 of the Constitution; all residual legislative powers are retained by the state parliaments, including powers over hospitals, education, police, the judiciary, roads, public transport and local government.

Each state and territory has its own legislature (unicameral in the case of the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the remaining states). The lower house is known as the Legislative Assembly (House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania) and the upper house the Legislative Council. The heads of the governments in each state and territory are called premiers and chief ministers, respectively. The Queen is represented in each state by a governor; an administrator in the Northern Territory, and the Governor-General in the ACT, have analogous roles.

Australia has several inhabited external territories: Norfolk Island, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and several largely uninhabited external territories: Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands and the Australian Antarctic Territory.

<h1>Foreign relations and military</h1>
 See main articles: Foreign relations of Australia, Australian Defence Force

Over recent decades, Australia&apos;s foreign relations have been driven by a close association with the United States, through the ANZUS pact and by a desire to develop relationships with Asia and the Pacific, particularly through ASEAN and the Pacific Islands Forum. In 2005 Australia secured an inaugural seat at the East Asia Summit following its accession to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, in which the Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings provide the main forum for co-operation. Much of Australia&apos;s diplomatic energy is focused on international trade liberalisation. Australia led the formation of the Cairns Group and APEC, and is a member of the OECD and the WTO. Australia has pursued several major bilateral free trade agreements, most recently the US–Australia Free Trade Agreement. Australia is a founding member of the United Nations, and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance. The 2005–06 budget provides A$2.5bn for development assistance;    7     as a percentage of GDP, this contribution is less than that of the UN Millennium Development Goals.

Australia&apos;s armed forces—the Australian Defence Force (ADF)—comprise the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army, and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). All branches of the ADF have been involved in UN and regional peacekeeping (most recently in East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Sudan), disaster relief, and armed conflict, including the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The government appoints the chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services; the current chief is Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston. In 2005–06, the defence budget is A$17.5bn.    7 

<h1> Geography and climate </h1>
:Main article: Geography of Australia 
Climatic zones in Australia.
Australia&apos;s 7,686,850 km² landmass is on the Indo-Australian Plate. Surrounded by the Indian, Southern and Pacific oceans, Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas. Australia has a total 25,760 km of coastline and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 km² (excluding the Australian Antarctic Territory). Climate is highly influenced by ocean currents, including the El Niño southern oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.

By far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid. Australia is the driest inhabited continent, the flattest, and has the oldest and least fertile soils. Only the south-east and south-west corners of the continent have a temperate climate. The northern part of the country, with a tropical climate, has a vegetation consisting of rainforest, woodland, grassland and desert. The Great Barrier Reef, the world&apos;s largest coral reef, lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 km. The world&apos;s two largest monoliths are located in Australia, Mount Augustus in Western Australia is the largest and Uluru in central Australia is the second largest.  At 2,228 m, Mount Kosciuszko on the Great Dividing Range is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland, although Mawson Peak on the remote Australian territory of Heard Island is taller at 2,745 m.

<h1> Flora and fauna </h1>
 See main articles: Flora of Australia, Fauna of Australia

The Tammar Wallaby is an Australian marsupial. The genome of the wallaby is currently being sequenced; when the sequencing is completed, it will be a major contribution to marsupial biology.

Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it covers a diverse range of habitats, from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Because of the great age and consequent low levels of fertility of the continent, its extremely variable weather patterns, and its long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia&apos;s biota is unique and diverse. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.    8     Many of Australia&apos;s ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced plant and animal species. The federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is a legal framework used for the protection of threatened species. Numerous protected areas have been created to protect and preserve Australia&apos;s unique ecosystems, 64 wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention, and 16 World Heritage Sites have been established. Australia was ranked 13th in the World on the 2005 Environmental Sustainability Index.
Wattle is the flower on the Coat of Arms of Australia.
Most Australian plant species are evergreen and many are adapted to fire and drought, including the eucalypts and acacias. Australia has a rich variety of endemic legume species that thrive in nutrient-poor soils because of their symbiosis with Rhizobia bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi. Well-known Australian fauna include monotremes (the platypus and echidna), and a host of marsupials, including the koala, kangaroo, wombat, and birds such as the emu, cockatoo, and kookaburra. The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people that traded with Indigenous Australians around 4000 BCE. Many plant and animal species became extinct soon after human settlement, including the Australian megafauna; many more have become extinct since European settlement, among them the Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger).

<h1> Economy </h1>
:Main article: Economy of Australia 
 Melbourne&apos;s population is around 3.8 million, the second largest in Australia
Australia has a prosperous, Western-style mixed economy, with a per capita GDP slightly higher than those of the UK, Germany and France. The country was ranked third in the United Nations&apos; 2005 Human Development Index and sixth in The Economist worldwide quality-of-life index 2005. In recent years, the Australian economy has been resilient in the face of global economic downturn. Rising output in the domestic economy has been offsetting the global slump, and business and consumer confidence remains robust. Australia&apos;s emphasis on reform is another key factor behind the economy&apos;s strength. In the 1980s, the Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating, started the process of modernising the Australian economy by floating the Australian dollar in 1983, and deregulating the financial system.    9     Since 1996, the Howard government has continued the process of micro-economic reform, including the partial deregulation of the labour market and the privatisation of state-owned businesses, most notably in the telecommunications industry.    10     Substantial reform of the indirect tax system was achieved in July 2000 with the introduction of a 10% Goods and Services Tax, which has slightly reduced the heavy reliance on personal and company income tax that still characterises Australia&apos;s tax system.

The Australian economy has not suffered a recession since the early 1990s. As of July 2005, unemployment was 5.0% with 10,030,300 persons employed.    11     The service sector of the economy, including tourism, education, and financial services, comprises 69% of GDP.    13     Agriculture and natural-resources represent only 3% and 5% of GDP, respectively, but contribute substantially to Australia&apos;s export performance. Australia&apos;s largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, South Korea and New Zealand.    12     Areas of concern to some economists include the chronically high current account deficit and also high levels of net foreign debt.

<h1> Demographics </h1>
:Main article: Demographics of Australia 
Most Australians live in urban areas; Sydney is the most populous city in Australia.

Most of the estimated 20.4 million Australians are descended from 19th- and 20th-century immigrants, the majority from Britain and Ireland. Australia&apos;s population has quadrupled since the end of World War I     19    , spurred by an ambitious immigration program. In 2001, the five largest groups of the 27.4% of Australians who were born overseas were from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy, Vietnam and China.    12     Following the abolition of the White Australia policy, numerous government initiatives have been established to encourage and promote racial harmony based on a policy of multiculturalism    15    . Australia’s population has increased by about 60 times since European settlement.

The self-declared indigenous population—including Torres Strait Islanders, who are of Melanesian descent—was 410,003 (2.2% of the total population) in 2001, a significant increase from the 1977 census, which showed an indigenous population of 115,953.    14     Indigenous Australians have higher rates of imprisonment and unemployment, lower levels of education and life expectancies for males and females that are 17 years lower than those of other Australians.    12     Perceived racial inequality is an ongoing political and human rights issue for Australians.
Fewer than 15% of Australians live in rural areas. This picture shows the Barossa Valley wine producing region of South Australia.

In common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. A large number of Australians (759,849 for the period 2002 03    16    ) live outside their home country.  Australia has maintained one of the most active immigration programs in the world to boost population growth. Most immigrants are skilled; the quota includes categories for family members and refugees.

English is the official language, and is spoken and written in a distinct variety known as Australian English. According to the 2001 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%) and Greek (1.4%). A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 Australian Aboriginal languages at the time of first European contact.  Only about 70 of these languages have survived, and all but 20 of these are now endangered. An indigenous language remains the main language for about 50,000 (0.02%) people. Australia has a sign language known as Auslan, which is the main language of about 6,500 deaf people.

The Australian Constitution guarantees the separation of church and state; there is no state religion. The 2001 census identified that 68% of Australians call themselves Christian: 27% identifying themselves as Roman Catholic and 21% as Anglican. Five per cent of Australians identify themselves as followers of non-Christian religions, and 26% as non-religious. Like many Western countries, the level of active participation in church worship is much lower than this; weekly attendance at church services is about 1.5 million, about 7.5% of the population.    17 

School attendance is compulsory throughout Australia between the ages of 6 15 years (16 years in South Australia and Tasmania), contributing to an adult literacy rate that is assumed to be 99%. Government grants have supported the establishment of Australia&apos;s 38 universities, and although several private universities have been established, the majority receive government funding. There is a state-based system of vocational training colleges, known as TAFE Institutes, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople. Approximately 58% of Australians between the ages of 25 and 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications.    12 

<h1> Culture </h1>
:Main article: Culture of Australia

Golden Summer, Eaglemont by Arthur Streeton (1889) is an early example of the rich tradition of Australian landscape painting.

The primary basis of Australian culture up until the mid-20th century was Anglo-Celtic, although distinctive Australian features had been evolving from the environment and indigenous culture. Over the past 50 years, Australian culture has been strongly influenced by American popular culture (particularly television and cinema), large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking countries, and Australia&apos;s Asian neighbours.

Australia has a long history of visual arts, starting with the cave and bark paintings of its indigenous peoples. From the time of European settlement, a common theme in Australian art has been the Australian landscape, seen in the works of Arthur Streeton, Arthur Boyd and Albert Namatjira, among others. The traditions of indigenous Australians are largely transmitted orally and are closely tied to ceremony and the telling of the stories of the Dreamtime. Australian Aboriginal music, dance and art have a palpable influence on contemporary Australian visual and performing arts. Australia has an active tradition of music, ballet and theatre; many of its performing arts companies receive public funding through the federal government&apos;s Australia Council. There is a symphony orchestra in each capital city, and a national opera company, Opera Australia, first made prominent by the renowned diva Dame Joan Sutherland; Australian music includes classical, jazz, and many popular music genres.

Australian literature has also been influenced by the landscape; the works of writers such as Banjo Paterson and Henry Lawson captured the experience of the Australian bush. The character of colonial Australia, as embodied in early literature, resonates with modern Australia and its perceived emphasis on egalitarianism, mateship, and anti-authoritarianism. In 1973, Patrick White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, the only Australian to have achieved this; he is recognised as one of the great English-language writers of the 20th century. Australian English is a major variety of the language; its grammar and spelling are largely based on those of British English, overlaid with a rich vernacular of unique lexical items and phrases, some of which have found their way into standard English.

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Australia&apos;s film industry has achieved critical and commercial successes. Each major city has daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review. According to Reporters Without Borders in 2005, Australia is in 31st position on a list of countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (9th)  and the United Kingdom (28th) but ahead of the United States. This ranking is primarily due to the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia. Most Australian print media in particular is under the control of either News Corporation or John Fairfax Holdings.
Australian rules football was developed in Australia and is played at amateur and professional levels.

Sport is an important part of Australian culture, assisted by a climate that favours outdoor activities; 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly participate in organised sporting activities    12    . At national and international levels, Australia has particularly strong teams in Australian rules football, Rugby League, Rugby Union, cricket and netball and excels in cycling and swimming. Australia has participated in every summer Olympic Games of the modern era, and every Commonwealth Games, and has hosted the 1956 and 2000 Summer Olympics; Australia has ranked among the top five medal-takers since 2000. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and élite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest rating television programs include the summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.    18

American Samoa (Samoan: Amerika Samoa) is an unorganized, unincorporated territory of the United States in the South Pacific Ocean, to the East of the larger state of Samoa.

<h1>History</h1>

Originally inhabited as early as 1000 BC, Samoa was reached by European explorers in the 18th century.

International rivalries in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 Treaty of Berlin in which Germany and the U.S. divided the Samoan archipelago. The U.S. formally occupied its portion a smaller group of eastern islands with the noted harbor of Pago Pago the following year. (see History of Samoa for more.)  The western islands are now the independent state of Samoa.

After the U.S. took possesion of American Samoa, the U.S. Navy built a coaling station in Pago Pago Bay for its Pacific Squadron and appointed a local Secretary. The navy secured a Deed of Cession of Tutuila in 1900 and a Deed of Cession of Manu a in 1904.  During World War II, U.S. Marines in American Samoa, outnumbering the local population, had a huge cultural influence.  After the war, Organic Act 4500, a U.S. Department of Interior-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was defeated in Congress, primarily through the efforts of American Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota.  These chiefs&apos; efforts led to the creation of a local legislature, the American Samoa Fono.

In time, the Navy-appointed governor was replaced by a locally elected one.  Although technically considered &quot;unorganized&quot; in that the U.S. Congress has not passed an Organic Act for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on July 1, 1967.  The U.S. Territory of American Samoa is on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, a listing which is disputed by the country.

<h1>Trivia</h1>
* American Samoa is the location of Rose Atoll, the southernmost point in the United States (if insular areas and territories are included); see extreme points for more information).
* Goods manufactured in territories or protectorates of the United States, including American Samoa, can be labeled &quot;Made in the USA.&quot;
* About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the National Football League. It has been estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the 50 United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American. A number have also ventured into professional wrestling.
* Persons born in American Samoa are United States nationals, but not United States citizens. This is virtually the only circumstance under which an individual would be one and not the other.
* The American Samoa national soccer team holds an unwanted world record in international soccer the record defeat in an international match, a 31-0 crushing by Australia on April 11, 2001.

An astronomer or astrophysicist is a scientist whose area of research is astronomy or astrophysics.
Johannes Hevelius was famed for his work on sunspots, and being the first to study the surface of the moon

Astronomy is generally thought to have begun in ancient Babylon by the Persian Zoroastrian priests (the magi). Recent studies of Babylonian records have shown them to be extremely accurate for the ancient night sky. Following the Babylonians, the egyptians also had an emphasis on observations of the sky.

Mixtures of religious interpretations of the sky, as mythic tales of the gods, led to a duality that we now identify as astrology. It is important to recognize that before about 1750, there was no distinction between astronomy and astrology.

Unlike most scientists, astronomers cannot directly interact with the celestial bodies, and so instead must resort to detailed observation in order to make discoveries. Generally, astronomers use telescopes or other imaging equipment to make such observations.

Amoeba (Chaos diffluens)
Foraminiferan (Ammonia tepida)
Heliozoan (Actinophrys sol)
Amoeboids are cells that move or feed by means of temporary projections, called pseudopods (false feet).  They have appeared in a number of different groups.  Some cells in multicellular animals may be amoeboid, for instance our white blood cells, which consume pathogens.  Many protists exist as individual amoeboid cells, or take such a form at some point in their life-cycle.  The most famous such organism is Amoeba proteus; the name amoebae is variously used to describe its close relatives, other organisms similar to it, or the amoeboids in general.

Amoeboids may be divided into several morphological categories based on the form and structure of the pseudopods.  Those where the pseudopods are supported by regular arrays of microtubules are called actinopods, and forms where they are not are called rhizopods, further divided into lobse, filose, and reticulose amoebae.  There is also a strange group of giant marine amoeboids, the xenophyophores, that do not fall into any of these categories.

* Lobose pseudopods are blunt, and there may be one or several on a cell, which is usually divided into a layer of clear ectoplasm surrounding more granular endoplasm.  Most, including Amoeba itself, move by the body mass flowing into an anterior pseudopod.  The vast majority form a monophyletic group called the Amoebozoa, which also includes most slime moulds.  A second group, the Percolozoa, includes protists that can transform between amoeboid and flagellate forms.

* Filose pseudopods are narrow and tapering.  The vast majority of filose amoebae, including all those that produce shells, are placed within the Cercozoa together with various flagellates that tend to have amoeboid forms.  The naked filose amoebae comprise two other groups, the vampyrellids and nucleariids.  The latter appear to be close relatives of animals and fungi.

* Reticulose pseudopods are cytoplasmic strands that branch and merge to form a net.  They are found most notably among the Foraminifera, a large group of marine protists that generally produce multi-chambered shells.  There are only a few sorts of naked reticulose amoeboids, notably the gymnophryids, and their relationships are not certain.

* Actinopods are divided into the radiolaria and heliozoa.  The radiolaria are mostly marine protists with complex internal skeletons, including central capsules that divide the cells into granular endoplasm and frothy ectoplasm that keeps them buoyant.  The heliozoa include both freshwater and marine forms that use their axopods to capture small prey, and only have simple scales or spines for skeletal elements.  Both groups appear to be polyphyletic.

Traditionally the amoeboid protozoa are grouped together as the Sarcodina, variously ranked from class to phylum, with each of the above categories as a formal subtaxon.  However, since they are all based on form rather than phylogeny, newer systems generally separate some out or abandon them entirely.  Most amoeboids are now included in two major supergroups - the Amoebozoa, including most lobose amoebae and slime moulds, and the Rhizaria, including the Cercozoa, Foraminifera, radiolarian classes and certain heliozoa.  However, amoeboids have appeared separately in many other groups, including various different lines of algae not listed above.

There are 95 printable ASCII characters, numbered 32 to 126.
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), generally pronounced  [ æski] , (ASK-ee) is a character set and a character encoding based on the Roman alphabet as used in modern English (see English alphabet). ASCII codes represent  text in computers, in other  communications equipment, and in control devices that work with text. Most recent character encoding has an ASCII-like base.

ASCII defines the following printable characters, presented here in numerical order of their ASCII value:

!&quot;#$%&amp;&apos;()*+,-./
0123456789:; ?
@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
PQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_
`abcdefghijklmno
pqrstuvwxyz

# Printable Representation, the Unicode glyphs reserved for representing control characters when it is necessary to print or display them rather than have them perform their intended function.
# Control key Sequence, the traditional key sequences for inputting control characters.  The caret (^) represents the &quot;Control&quot; or &quot;Ctrl&quot; key that must be held down while pressing the second key in the sequence.  The caret-key representation is also used by some software to represent control characters.
# The Backspace character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or   key on some systems.
# The Delete character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Del&quot; key.  It can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Backspace&quot;, &quot;Bksp&quot;, or   key on some systems.
# The Escape character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Escape&quot; or &quot;Esc&quot; key on some systems.
# The Carriage Return character can also be entered by pressing the &quot;Return&quot;, &quot;Ret&quot;, &quot;Enter&quot;, or   key on most systems.
# The ambiguity surrounding the Backspace key comes from systems that translated the DEL control character into a BS (backspace) before transmitting it.  Some software was unable to process the character and would display &quot;^H&quot; instead.  &quot;^H&quot; persists in messages today as a deliberate humorous device, e.g. &quot;there&apos;s a sucker^H^H^H^H^H^H potential customer born every minute&quot;.  A less common variant of this involves the use of &quot;^W&quot;, which in some text editors means &quot;delete previous word&quot;. The example sentence would therefore also work as &quot;there&apos;s a sucker^W potential customer born every minute&quot;.

<h1>ASCII printable characters</h1>

Code 32, the &quot;space&quot; character, denotes the space between words, as produced by the large space-bar of a keyboard. Codes 33 to 126, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, punctuation marks, and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Seven-bit ASCII provided seven &quot;national&quot; characters and, if the combined hardware and software permit, can use overstrikes to simulate some additional international characters: in such a scenario a backspace can precede a grave accent (which the American and British standards, but only those standards, also call &quot;opening single quotation mark&quot;), a tilde, or a breath mark (inverted vel).

Processors can convert uppercase characters to lowercase by adding 32 to their ASCII value; in binary, devices can accomplish this simply by setting the sixth-least significant bit to 1.

<h1>Aliases for ASCII</h1>

RFC 1345 (published in June 1992) and the  IANA registry of character sets (ongoing), both recognize the following case-insensitive aliases for ASCII as suitable for use on the Internet:

* ANSI_X3.4-1968 (canonical name)
* ANSI_X3.4-1986
* ASCII
* US-ASCII (preferred MIME name)
* us
* ISO646-US
* ISO_646.irv:1991
* iso-ir-6
* IBM367
* cp367
* csASCII

Of these, only the aliases &quot;US-ASCII&quot; and &quot;ASCII&quot; have achieved widespread use. One often finds them in the optional &quot;charset&quot; parameter in the Content-Type header of some MIME messages, in the equivalent &quot;meta&quot; element of some HTML documents, and in the encoding declaration part of the prolog of some XML documents.

<h1>Variants of ASCII</h1>

As computer technology spread throughout the world, different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ASCII in order to facilitate the expression of non-English languages that used Roman-based alphabets. One could class some of these variations as &quot;ASCII extensions&quot;, although some mis-apply that term to cover all variants, including those that do not preserve ASCII&apos;s character-map in the 7-bit range.

ISO 646 (1972), the first attempt to remedy the pro-English-language bias, created compatibility problems, since it remained a 7-bit character-set. It made no additional codes available, so it reassigned some in language-specific variants. It thus became impossible to know what character a code represented without knowing which variant to work with, and text-processing systems could generally cope with only one variant anyway.

Eventually, improved technology brought out-of-band means to represent the information formerly encoded in the eighth bit of each byte, freeing this bit to add another 128 additional character-codes for new assignments. For example, IBM developed 8-bit code pages, such as code page 437, which replaced the control-characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces, and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 bytes. Operating systems such as DOS supported these code-pages, and manufacturers of IBM PCs supported them in hardware.

Eight-bit standards such as ISO/IEC 8859 and MacRoman developed as true extensions of ASCII, leaving the original character-mapping intact and just adding additional values above the 7-bit range. This enabled the representation of a broader range of languages, but these standards continued to suffer from incompatibilities and limitations. Still, ISO/IEC 8859-1 and original 7-bit ASCII remain the most common character encodings in use today.

Unicode and the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal Character Set (UCS) have a much wider array of characters, and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant ISO/IEC 8859 and ASCII rapidly in many environments. While ASCII basically uses 7-bit codes, Unicode and the UCS use relatively abstract &quot;code points&quot;: non-negative integer numbers that map, using different encoding forms and schemes, to sequences of one or more 8-bit bytes. To permit backward compatibility, Unicode and the UCS assign the first 128 code points to the same characters as ASCII. One can therefore think of ASCII as a 7-bit encoding scheme for a very small subset of Unicode and of the UCS. The popular UTF-8 encoding-form prescribes the use of one to four 8-bit code values for each code point character, and equates exactly to ASCII for the code values below 128. Other encoding forms such as UTF-16 resemble ASCII in how they represent the first 128 characters of Unicode, but tend to use 16 or 32 bits per character, so they require conversion for compatibility.

The portmanteau word ASCIIbetical has evolved to describe the collation of data in ASCII-code order rather than &quot;standard&quot; alphabetical order (which requires some tricky computation, and varies with language).

ASCII contains many characters not in common use (or at least not commonly spoken of) outside of the computing context; the &quot;popularization&quot; of these characters encouraged users to agree on standard names for them. See the pronunciation guide in the external links, below.

The abbreviation ASCIIZ or ASCIZ refers to a null-terminated ASCII string.

:This article is about the continent; for other things named Africa, see Africa (disambiguation)

Africa is the world&apos;s second-largest continent and second most populous after Asia. At about 30,244,050 km  (11,677,240 mi ) including its adjacent islands, it covers 20.3 percent of the total land area on Earth. With over 800 million human inhabitants in 54 countries, it accounts for about one seventh of the world human population.A satellite composite image of Africa

<h1>Etymology</h1>
World map showing Africa (geographically)The name Africa came into Western use through the Romans, who used the name Africa terra — &quot;land of the Afri&quot; (plural, or &quot;Afer&quot; singular) — for the northern part of the continent, as the province of Africa with its capital Carthage, corresponding to modern-day Tunisia.

The origin of Afer may either come from:
*the Phoenician `afar, dust;
*the Afri, a tribe — possibly Berber — who dwelt in North Africa in the Carthage area;
*the Greek word aphrike, meaning without cold (see also List of traditional Greek place names); 
*or the Latin word aprica, meaning sunny.

The historian Leo Africanus (1495-1554) attributed the origin to the Greek word phrike (     , meaning &quot;cold and horror&quot;), combined with the negating prefix a-, so meaning a land free of cold and horror. However, the change of sound from ph to f in Greek is datable to about the first century, so this cannot really be the origin of the name.

Egypt was considered part of Asia by the ancients, and first assigned to Africa by the geographer Ptolemy (85 - 165 AD), who accepted Alexandria as Prime Meridian and made the isthmus of Suez and the Red Sea the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of Africa expanded with their knowledge.

<h1>Geography</h1>
Main article: Geography of Africa

Africa in the Blue marble picture, with Antarctica to the south, and the Sahara and Arabian peninsula at the top of the globe

Africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the main mass of the Earth&apos;s surface. It includes within its remarkably regular outline an area, of c. 30,244,050 km  (11,677,240 mi ), including the islands.

Separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, it is joined to Asia at its northeast extremity by the Isthmus of Suez (transected by the Suez Canal), 130 km (80 miles) wide. (Geopolitically, Egypt&apos;s Sinai Peninsula east of the Suez Canal is often considered part of Africa, as well.)  From the most northerly point, Cape Spartel in Morocco, a little west of Cape Blanc, in 37 21  N, to the most southerly point, Cape Agulhas in South Africa, 34 51 15  S, is a distance approximately of 8,000 km (5,000 miles); from Cape Verde, 17 33 22  W, the westernmost point, to Ras Hafun in Somalia, 51 27 52  E, the most easterly projection, is a distance (also approximately) of 7,400 km (4,600 miles). The length of coast-line is 26,000 km (16,100 miles) and the absence of deep indentations of the shore is shown by the fact that Europe, which covers only 9,700,000 km  (3,760,000 square miles), has a coast-line of 32,000 km (19,800 miles).

The main structural lines of the continent show both the east-to-west direction characteristic, at least in the eastern hemisphere, of the more northern parts of the world, and the north-to-south direction seen in the southern peninsulas. Africa is thus composed of two segments at right angles, the northern running from east to west, the southern from north to south, the subordinate lines corresponding in the main to these two directions.

<h1>History</h1>
Main article: History of Africa
Map of Africa 1890

Africa is home to the oldest inhabited territory on earth, with the human race originating from this continent. The Ishango Bone, carbon-dated to c. 25,000 years ago, shows tallies in mathematical notation.

Throughout humanity&apos;s prehistory, Africa (like all other continents) had no nation states, and was instead inhabited by groups of hunter-gatherers. 
Around 3300 B.C. the nation state of Egypt developed, which existed with various levels of influence until 343 B.C. Other civilizations include Ethiopia, the Nubian kingdom, the kingdoms of the Sahel (Ghana, Mali, and Songhai) and Great Zimbabwe.

In 1482, the Portuguese established the first of many trading stations along the Guinea coast at Elmina. The chief commodities dealt in were slaves, gold, ivory and spices. The discovery of America in 1492 was followed by a great development of the slave trade, which, before the Portuguese era, had been an overland trade almost exclusively.

But at the same time that serfdom was ending in Europe, in the early 19th century the European imperial powers staged a massive &quot;scramble for Africa&quot; and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, the Black American colony, and Ethiopia. This occupation continued until after the conclusion of the Second World War, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.

Today, Africa is home to over 50 independent countries, all but 2 of which still have the borders drawn up during the era of European colonialism.

<h1>Politics</h1>
Map showing European claimants to the African continent at the beginning of World War I
<h2>Colonial Africa</h2>
Colonialism had a destabilizing effect on what had been a number of ethnic groups that is still being felt in African politics. Prior to European influence, national borders were not much of a concern, with Africans generally following the practice of other areas of the world, such as the Arabian peninsula, where a group&apos;s territory was congruent with its military or trade influence. The European insistence of drawing borders around territories to isolate them from those of other colonial powers often had the effect of separating otherwise contiguous political groups, or forcing traditional enemies to live side by side with no buffer between them. For example, the Congo River, although it appears to be a natural geographic boundary, had groups that otherwise shared a language, culture or other similarity who resided on both sides. The division of the land between Belgium and France along the river isolated these groups from each other. Those who lived in Saharan or Sub-Saharan Africa and traded across the continent for centuries often found themselves crossing &quot;borders&quot; that often existed only on European maps.

In nations that had substantial European populations, for example Rhodesia and South Africa, systems of second-class citizenship were often set up in order to give Europeans political power far in excess of their numbers. However, the lines were not often drawn strictly across racial lines. In Liberia, the citizens who were descendants of American slaves managed to have a political system for over 100 years that gave ex-slaves and natives to the area roughly equal legislative power despite the fact the ex-slaves were outnumbered ten to one in the general population. The inspiration for this system was the United States Senate, which ironically balanced the power of free and slave states despite the much larger population of the former.

Europeans often changed the balance of power, created ethnic divides where they did not previously exist, and introduced a cultural dichotomy detrimental to the native inhabitants in the areas they controlled. For example, in what is now Rwanda and Burundi, two tribes Hutus and Tutsis had merged into one culture by the time Belgian colonists had taken control of the region in the 19th century. No longer divided by ethnicity as intermingling, inter-marriage, and merging of cultural practices over the centuries had long since erased visible signs of a culture divide, the Belgians instituted a policy of racial categorization, upon taking control of the region, as racial based categorization and philosophies was a fixture of the European culture of that time. The term Hutu originally referred to the agricultural-based Bantu speaking tribes that moved into present day Rwandan and Burundi from the West, and the term Tutsi referred to North Eastern cattle-based tribes that migrated into the region later. The terms to the indigenous peoples eventually came to describe a person&apos;s economic class. Those individuals who owned roughly 10 or more cattle were considered Tutsi, and those with fewer were considered Hutu, regardless of ancestral history. This was not a strict line but a general rule of thumb, and one could move from Hutu to Tutsi and vice versa.

The Belgians introduced a racialised system. Those individuals who had characteristics the Europeans admired  mdash; fairer skin, ample height, narrow noses, etc.  mdash; were given power amongst the colonized peoples. The Belgians determined these features were more ideally Hamitic, Hamitic in turn being more ideally European and belonged to those people closest to Tutsi in ancestry. They instituted a policy of issuing identity cards based on this philosophy. Those closest to this ideal were proclaimed Tutsi and those not were proclaimed Hutu.

<h2>Post-colonial Africa</h2>
Since independence, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and authoritarianism. The vast majority of African nations are republics that operate under some form of the presidential system of rule. Few nations in Africa have been able to sustain democratic governments, instead cycling through a series of brutal coups and military dictatorships.

A number of Africa&apos;s post-colonial political leaders were poorly educated and ignorant on matters of governance; great instability, however, was mainly the result of marginalization of other ethnic groups and graft under these leaders.

As well, many used the positions of power to ignite ethnic conflicts that had been exacerbated, or even created, under colonial rule. In many countries, the military was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order and ruled most nations in Africa during the 70s and early 80s.

During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s Africa had over 70 coups and 13 presidential assassinations.

Cold War conflicts between the United States and the Soviet Union also played a role in the instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. Many countries in Northern Africa received Soviet military aid, while many in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States and/or France. The 1970s saw an escalation as newly independent Angola and Mozambique aligned themselves with the Soviet Union and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence.

Border and territorial disputes have also been common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.

Failed government policies and political corruption have also resulted in many widespread famines, and significant portions of Africa remain with distribution systems unable to disseminate enough food or water for the population to survive. The spread of disease is also rampant, especially the spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the associated Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), which has become a deadly epidemic on the continent.

Despite numerous hardships, there have been some signs the continent has hope for the future. Democratic governments seem to be spreading, though are not yet the majority (National Geographic claims 13 African nations can be considered truly democratic). As well, many nations have at least nominally recognized basic human rights for all citizens, though in practice these are not always recognized, and have created reasonably independent judiciaries.

There are clear signs of increased networking among African organisations and states. In the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (former Zaire), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, about half-a-dozen neighbouring African countries got involved (see also Second Congo War). The death toll has been estimated by some to be 3.5 million since the conflict began in 1998. This might play a role similar to that of World War II for Europe, after which the people in the neighbouring countries decide to integrate their societies in such a way that war between them becomes as unthinkable as a war between, say, France and Germany would be today.

Political associations such as the African Union are also offering hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent&apos;s many countries.

Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often times as a &apos;side-effect&apos; of civil war.  Notable countries with reported major violations include, but are not limited to, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Cote d&apos;Ivoire.  Reported violations include cannibalism, mutilation, and rape.

<h2>Modern Africa</h2>
Most western countries place limitations on aid to African nations. These limitations are often used to control the governments of these African nations; as a result, these nations are turning to non-traditional sources of financial aid. China has increasingly provided financial aid to Africa in order to secure contracts on natural resources. There usually is no political prescription.

<h1>Economy</h1>
Main article: Economy of Africa

Africa is the world&apos;s poorest inhabited continent: the United Nations&apos;  Human Development Report 2003 (of 175 countries) found that positions 151 (Gambia) to 175 (Sierra Leone) were taken up entirely by African nations.

It has had (and in some ways is still having) a shaky and uncertain transition from colonialism, with increases in corruption and despotism being major contributing factors to its poor economic situation. While rapid growth in China and now India, and moderate growth in South America, has lifted millions beyond subsistence living, Africa has gone backwards in terms of foreign trade, investment, and per capita income. This poverty has widespread effects, including lower life expectancy, violence, and instability - factors intertwined with the continent&apos;s poverty.

The major economic success is South Africa, which is developed to the extent that it has its own mature stock exchange. This is partly due to its wealth of natural resources, being the world&apos;s leading producer of both gold and diamonds, and partly due to its well-established legal system. South Africa also has access to capital, markets and know how.

Nigeria sits on one of the largest proven oil reserves in the world and has the highest population among nations in Africa, with one of the fastest growing. However, most of the oil industry is foreign owned, and the industry is rife with corruption at the national level so that very little oil money stays in the country, and what does goes to a very small percentage of the population.

<h1>Demographics</h1>
Africans may be grouped according to whether they live north or south of the Sahara Desert; these groups are called North Africans and Sub-Saharan Africans, respectively. Arabic-speaking Arab-Berber peoples predominate in North Africa, while Sub-Saharan Africa is dominated by a number of disparate populations. There is a great diversity of physical types among Sub-Saharan African peoples -- ranging from the Masai and Tutsi, known for their tall stature, to Pygmies who are among the world&apos;s shortest adults.

Aside from the Nilotic groups of southern Sudan, some Nilotic groups in Ethiopia, and a Bantu African minority in Somalia, Africans from the Northeast parts of the continent typically have a different appearance from those in other regions. Speakers of Bantu languages are the majority in southern, central and east Africa proper; but there are also several Nilotic groups in East Africa, and a few remaining indigenous Khoisan (&apos;San&apos; or &apos;Busmmen&apos;) and Pygmy peoples in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon and southern Somalia. In the Kalahari Desert of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot;San&quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot;Hottentots&quot;) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. &quot;Pygmies&quot; are the indigenous people of central Africa.

The peoples of North Africa are primarily Arab-Berber; the Arabs who arrived in the 7th century have assimilated the indigenous Berber people. The Semitic Phoenicians, and the European Greeks and Romans settled in North Africa as well. Berber peoples remain a significant minority within Morocco and Algeria, and are present in Tunisia and Libya. The Tuareg and other often-nomadic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. Nubians also developed civilizations in North Africa during ancient times.

Some Ethiopian and Eritrean groups (like the Amhara and Tigray, collectively known as &quot;Habesha&quot;) have Semitic (Sabaean) ancestry. The Somalis as a people originated in the Ethiopian highlands, but most Somali clans can trace Arab ancestry as well. Sudan and Mauritania are divided between a mostly Arab north and a native African south (although many of the &quot;Arabs&quot; of Sudan clearly have African ancestry, and are far off in appearance from Arabs in Iraq or Algeria). Some areas of East Africa, particularly the island of Zanzibar and the Kenyan island of Lamu, received Arab and Asian Muslim settlers and merchants throughout the Middle Ages.

Beginning in the 16th century, Europeans such as the Portuguese and Dutch began to establish trading posts and forts along the coasts of western and southern Africa. Eventually, a large number of Dutch, augmented by French Huguenots and Germans settled in what is today South Africa. Their descendants, the Afrikaners, are the largest European-descended group in South Africa today. In the 19th century, a second phase of colonization brought a large number of French and British settlers to Africa. The French settled in large numbers in Algeria, and on a smaller scale in other areas of North and West Africa. The British settled in South Africa as well as the colony of Rhodesia, and in the highlands of what is now Kenya. Smaller numbers of European soldiers, businessmen, and officials also established themselves in administrative centers such as Nairobi and Dakar. Decolonization during the 1960s often resulted in the mass exodus of European-descended settlers out of Africa   especially in Algeria, Kenya, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). However, in South Africa, the colonial minority (10% of the population) has largely remained in the country after the end of European rule in 1994.

European colonization also brought sizeable groups of Asians, particularly people from the Indian subcontinent, to British colonies. Large Indian communities are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and east African countries. A fairly large Indian community in Uganda was expelled by the dictator Idi Amin in 1972, though many have since returned.

<h1>Languages</h1>

Main article: African languages

By most estimates Africa contains well over a thousand languages. There are four major language families native to Africa.

* The Afro-Asiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout North Africa, East Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.
* The Nilo-Saharan language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are mainly spoken in Chad, Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, and northern Tanzania.
* The Niger-Congo language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages. A substantial number of them are the Bantu languages spoken in much of sub-Saharan Africa. 
* The Khoisan languages number about 50 and are spoken in Southern Africa by approximately 120 000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are endangered. The Khoi and San peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Languages of Europe have also acquired prominence; English, French,Portuguese, and Spanish, are official languages in several countries as a result of colonization. In South Africa, which was unique in having a significant number of European settlers, English and Afrikaans are the native languages of a significant portion of the population.

<h1>Culture</h1>
Rather than one culture, Africa has a number of cultures that overlap. The most conventional distinction is that between sub-Saharan Africa and the northern countries from Egypt to Morocco, who largely associate themselves with Arabic culture. In this comparison, the nations to the south of the Sahara are considered to consist of many cultural areas, in particular that of the Bantu linguistic group.

Divisions may also be made between Francophone Africa and the rest of Africa, in particular the former British colonies of southern and East Africa. Another cultural fault-line is that between those Africans living traditional lifestyles and those who are essentially modern. The traditionalists are sometimes subdivided into pastoralists and agriculturalists.

African art reflects the diversity of African cultures. The oldest existing art from Africa are 6000-year old carvings found in Niger, while the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt was the world&apos;s tallest architectural accomplishment for four thousand years until the creation of the Eiffel Tower. The Ethiopian complex of monolithic churches at Lalibela, of which the Church of St. George is representative, is regarded as another marvel of engineering.

The music of Africa is one of its most dynamic art forms. Egypt has long been a cultural focus of the Arab world, while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular west Africa, was transmitted through the Atlantic slave trade to modern blues, jazz, reggae, rap, and rock and roll. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of soukous, dominated by the music of the Democratic Republic of Congo. A recent development of the 21st century is the emergence of African hip hop, in particular a form from Senegal is blended with traditional mbalax. Recently in South Africa, a form of music related to house music known under the name Kwaito has developed, although the country has been home to its own form of South African jazz for some time, while Afrikaans music is completely distinct and comprised mostly of traditional Boere musiek, and forms of Folk and Rock.

<h1>Religion</h1>
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, with Christianity and Islam being the most widespread. Approximately 40% of all Africans are Christians and another 40% Muslims. Roughly 20% of Africans primarily follow indigenous African religions. A small number of Africans also have beliefs from the Judaic tradition, such as the Beta Israel and Lemba tribes.

The indigenous African religions tend to revolve around animism and ancestor worship. A common thread in traditional belief systems was the division of the spiritual world into &quot;helpful&quot; and &quot;harmful&quot;. Helpful spirits are usually deemed to include ancestor spirits that help their descendants, and powerful spirits that protected entire communities from natural disaster or attacks from enemies; whereas harmful spirits include the souls of murdered victims who were buried without the proper funeral rites, and spirits used by hostile spirit mediums to cause illness among their enemies. While the effect of these early forms of worship continues to have a profound influence, belief systems have evolved as they interact with other religions.

The formation of the Old Kingdom of Egypt in the third millennium BCE marked the first known complex religious system on the continent. Around the ninth century BCE, Carthage (in present-day Tunisia) was founded by the Phoenicians, and went on to become a major cosmopolitan center of the ancient world in which deities from neighboring Egypt, Rome and the Etruscan city-states were worshipped.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Church officially dates from the fourth century, and is thus one of the first established Christian churches anywhere. At first Christian Orthodoxy made gains in modern-day Sudan and other neighbouring regions; however following the spread of Islam, growth was slow and restricted to the highlands.

Islam entered Africa as Muslims conquered North Africa between 640 and 710, beginning with Egypt. They established Mogadishu, Melinde, Mombasa, Kilwa, and Sofala, following the sea trade down the coast of East Africa, and diffusing through the Sahara desert into the interior of Africa -- following in particular the paths of Muslim traders. Muslims were also among the Asian peoples who later settled in British-ruled Africa.

Many Africans were converted to West European forms of Christianity during the colonial period. In the last decades of the twentieth century, various sects of Charismatic Christianity rapidly grew. A number of Roman Catholic African bishops have even been mentioned as possible papal candidates. African Christians appear to be more socially conservative than their co-religionists in much of the industrialized world, which has quite recently led to tensions within denominations such as the Anglican and Methodist Churches.

This animation moves at 10 frames per second.

This animation moves at 2 frames per second. At this rate, the individual frames should be discernible.

Animation is the illusion of motion created by the consecutive display of images of static elements. In film and video production, this refers to techniques by which which each frame of a film or movie is produced individually. These frames may be generated by computers, or by photographing a drawn or painted image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see claymation and stop motion), and then photographing the result with a special animation camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed, there is an illusion of continuous movement due to the phenomenon known as persistence of vision. Generating such a film tends to be very labour intensive and tedious, though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process.

Graphics file formats like GIF, MNG, SVG and Flash allow animation to be viewed on a computer or over the Internet.

<h1>History</h1>

For a more in-depth look at the history of animation, please see the Wikipedia articles &quot;Animated cartoon&quot; and &quot;History of Animation&quot;.

The major use of animation has always been for entertainment. However, there is growing use of instructional animation and educational animation to support explanation and learning.

The &quot;classic&quot; form of animation, the &quot;animated cartoon&quot;, as developed in the early 1900s and refined by Walt Disney and others, requires up to 24 distinct drawings for one second of animation. This technique is described in detail in the article Traditional animation.

Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for TV and movies comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry.

Limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using &quot;short cuts&quot; in the animation process. This method was pioneered by UPA and popularized (some say exploited) by Hanna-Barbera, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television. It is also the basis of animation.

The animations shown before consist of these 6 frames.

Apollo (Greek:        , Apóll n;        ) is a god in Greek and Roman mythology, the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin of Artemis (goddess of the hunt), one of the most important and many-sided of the Olympian divinities. In later times he became in part confused or equated with Helios, god of the sun, and his sister similarly equated with Selene, goddess of the moon in religious contexts. But Apollo and Helios/Sol remained quite separate beings in literary/mythological texts.  In Etruscan mythology, he was known as Aplu.

<h1>Worship</h1>
Apollo is considered to have dominion over the plague, light, healing, colonists, medicine, archery, poetry, prophecy, dance, reason, intellectualism, Shamans, and as the patron defender of herds and flocks.  Apollo had a famous oracle in Crete and other notable ones in Clarus and Branchidae.Apollo, the son of Zeus and the mortal Leto.

Apollo is known as the leader of the Muses (&quot;musagetes&quot;) and director of their choir.  His attributes include: swans, wolves, dolphins, bows and arrows, a laurel crown, the cithara (or lyre) and plectrum.  The sacrificial tripod is another attribute, representative of his prophetic powers. The Pythian Games were held in his honor every four years at Delphi. Paeans were the name of hymns sung to Apollo.

The most usual attributes of Apollo were the lyre and the bow; the tripod especially was dedicated to him as the god of prophecy. Among plants, the bay, used in expiatory sacrifices and also for making the crown of victory at the Pythian games, and the palm-tree, under which he was born in Delos, were sacred to him; among animals and birds, the wolf, the roe, the swan, the hawk, the raven, the crow, the snake, the mouse, the grasshopper and the griffin, a mixture of the eagle and the lion evidently of Eastern origin. The swan and grasshopper symbolize music and song; the hawk, raven, crow and snake have reference to his functions as the god of prophecy.

The chief festivals held in honour of Apollo were the Carneia, Daphnephoria, Delia, Hyacinthia, Pyanepsia, Pythia and Thargelia.

Among the Romans the worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks. There is a tradition that the Delphian oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus, and in 430 a temple was dedicated to Apollo on the occasion of a pestilence, and during the Second Punic War (in 212) the Ludi Apollinares were instituted in his honour.  It was in the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, that his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome. After the battle of Actium, Augustus enlarged his old temple, dedicated a portion of the spoil to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also erected a new temple on the Palatine hill and transferred the secular games, for which Horace composed his Carmen Saeculare, to Apollo and Diana.

As god of colonization, Apollo gave guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization,750-550 BC.  According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists find the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite cuneiform texts mention a Minor Asian god called Appaliunas or Apalunas in connection with the city of Wilusa, which is now regarded as being identical with the Greek Illios by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo’s title of Lykegenes can simply be read as &quot;born in Lycia&quot;, which effectively severs the god&apos;s supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology).

Apollo popularly (e.g., in literary criticism) represents harmony, order, and reason - characteristics contrasted by those of Dionysus, god of wine, who popularly represents emotion and chaos.  The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea he would leave the Delphi Oracle to Dionysus.

Together with Athena, Apollo (under the name Phevos) was controversially designated as a mascot of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

The worship of Apollo has revived with the rise of Hellenismos, and the contemporary Pagan movement. One example of this revival is the group,  Kyklos Apollon.

<h2>Apollo Delphinios</h2>

A recent study published in 2005 by researchers at the University of Leicester has unravelled a 2,700 year old mystery concerning The Oracle of Delphi.  In ancient times, the constellation Delphinus would have been rising in the eastern sky in late December and early January, the same time that some cities were sacrificing to Apollo Delphinios. In Delphi, this sacrifice took place about a month later. The researchers have confirmed that this is because the temple of Apollo at Delphi is overlooked by huge cliffs to the east. These block out the view of the lower part of the eastern sky, thus delaying the appropriate time of sacrifice for almost a full month compared to other cities on the greek plains.

<h1>Etymology of the name</h1>
The name Apollo might have been derived from a Pre-Hellenic compound Apo-ollon, likely related to an archaic verb Apo-ell- and literally meaning &quot;he who elbows off&quot;, that is &quot;the Dispelling One.&quot; Indeed, he seems to have personified dispelling power, which would relate to his association with the darkness-dispelling power of the morning sun and the conceived power of reason and prophecy to dispel doubt and ignorance. 
In addition:

* The apparent expelling character of city walls and doorways as bulwarks against trespassers
* The people-dispelling nature of disembarkations and expatriations to colonies
* The disease-dispelling character of healing
* The predator-dispelling character of a shepherd tending his flocks
* The pest-dispelling nature of a farmer growing crops
* The power of music and the arts to dispel discord and barbary
* The highly important power of fit and skilled young men to dispel intruders and invading armies.

An explanation given by Plutarch in Moralia is that Apollon signified a unity, since pollon meant &quot;many,&quot; and the prefix a- was a negative. Thus, Apollon could be read as meaning &quot;deprived of multitude.&quot; Apollo was consequently associated with the monad.

Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric       , which means assembly, so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation       (&quot;fold&quot;), in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.

Apollo, Greek god of the sun and music.

<h1> Apollo in art </h1>

In art, Apollo is usually depicted as a handsome young man, almost always beardless, and often with a lyre or bow in hand.

<h1> Birth </h1>

When Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant and that Hera&apos;s husband, Zeus, was the father, she banned Leto from giving birth on &quot;terra-firma&quot;, or the mainland, or any island at sea.  She found the floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island, and gave birth there.  The island was surrounded by swans.  As a gesture of gratitude, Delos was secured with four pillars.  The island later became sacred to Apollo.  Alternatively, Hera kidnapped Ilithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor.  The other gods forced Hera to let her go.  Either way, Artemis was born first and then assisted with the birth of Apollo.  Another version states that Artemis was born one day before Apollo, on the island of Ortygia and that she helped Leto cross the sea to Delos the next day to give birth to Apollo. Apollo was born on the 7th day (            ) of the month Thargelion according to Delian, of the month Bysios according to Delphian, tradition. The 7th and 20th, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.

<h1> Youth </h1>

In his youth, Apollo killed the vicious dragon Python, which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring, according to some because Python had attempted to rape Leto while she was pregnant with Apollo and Artemis.This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the Oracle at Delphi to give her prophesies.  Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of Gaia.

<h1> Apollo and Admetus </h1>

As punishment, Apollo was banned from Olympus for nine years.  During this time he served as shepherd or cowherd for King Admetus of Pherae in Thessaly.  Since Admetus was good to Apollo, the god promised him that when time came for King Admetus to die, another would be allowed to take his place instead.  Admetus then fell in love with Alcestis.  Her father, though, King Pelias would only give permission if Admetus rode a chariot pulled by lions and boars and other wild animals.  Apollo helped Admetus accomplish this, and the pair wed.  When time came for Admetus to die, Alcestis agreed to die for him.  Heracles intervened and both of the pair were allowed to live.

When he returned after the nine years, Apollo came disguised as a dolphin and brought Cretan priests to help found his cult in Delphi.  He also blessed the priestess of the Oracle at Delphi, making it one of the most famous and accurate oracles in Greece.  He had other oracles, including Clarus and Branchidae.

<h1> Apollo During the Trojan War </h1>

Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment during the Trojan War in rage because the Greeks had kidnapped Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo&apos;s priest. He demanded her return, and the Greeks eventually complied.

When Diomedes injured Aeneas during the Trojan War, Apollo rescued him.  First, Aphrodite tried to rescue Aeneas but Diomedes injured her as well.  Aeneas was then enveloped in a cloud by Apollo, who took him to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy. Artemis healed Aeneas there.

Apollo is also to have been said to have aided Paris in the killing of Achilles.

<h1> Niobe </h1>

A Queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion, Niobe boasted of her superiority to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two.  Apollo killed her sons as they practiced athletics, with the last begging for his life, and Artemis her daughters.  Apollo and Artemis used poisoned arrows to kill them, though according to some versions of the myth, a number of the Niobids were spared (Chloris, usually).  Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.  A devastated Niobe fled to Mt. Siplyon in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept, or committed suicide.  Her tears formed the river Achelous.  Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.

<h1> Apollo&apos;s romantic life and children </h1>

<h2> Heterosexual relationships </h2>

<h3> Daphne </h3>

Apollo chased the nymph Daphne, daughter of Peneus, who had scorned him. His infatuation was caused by an arrow from Eros, who was jealous because Apollo had made fun of his archery skills.  Eros also claimed to be irritated by Apollo&apos;s singing. Simultaneously, however, Eros had shot a hate arrow into Daphne, causing her to be repulsed by Apollo. Following a spirited chase by Apollo, Daphne prayed to Mother earth (alternatively, her father- a river god) to help her and he changed her into a Lauraceae tree, which became sacred to Apollo.

<h3> Leucothea </h3>

Apollo had an affair with a mortal princess named Leucothea, daughter of Orchamus and sister of Clytia. Leucothea loved Apollo who disguised himself as Leucothea&apos;s mother to gain entrance to her chambers. Clytia, jealous of her sister because she wanted Apollo for herself, told Orchamus the truth, betraying her sister&apos;s trust and confidence in her. Enraged, Orchamus ordered Leucothea to be buried alive. Apollo refused to forgive Clytia for betraying his beloved, and a grieving Clytia wilted and slowly died. Apollo changed her into an incense plant, either heliotrope or sunflower, which follows the sun every day.

<h3> Marpessa </h3>

Marpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well.  Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.

<h3> Castalia </h3>

Castalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved.  She fled from him and dived into the spring at Delphi, at the base of Mt. Parnassos, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire poets.

<h3> Cyrene/Aristaeus </h3>

By Cyrene, Apollo had a son named Aristaeus, who became the patron god of cattle, fruit trees, hunting, husbandry and bee-keeping. He was also a culture-hero and taught humanity dairy skills and the use of nets and traps in hunting, as well as how to cultivate olives.

<h3> Hecuba </h3>

With Hecuba, wife of King Priam of Troy, Apollo had a son named Troilius.  An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilius reached the age of twenty alive.  He and his sister, Polyxena were ambushed and killed by Achilles.

<h3> Cassandra </h3>

Apollo also fell in love with Cassandra, daughter of Hecuba and Priam, and Troilius&apos; half-sister.  He promised Cassandra the gift of prophecy to seduce her, but she rejected him afterwards.  Enraged, Apollo indeed gifted her with the ability to know the future, with a curse that no one would ever believe her.

<h3> Coronis </h3>

Coronis, daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths, was another of Apollo&apos;s liaisons.  Pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus.  A crow informed Apollo of the affair. When first informed he disbelieved the crow and turned all crows black (where they were previously white) as a punishment for speading untruths. When he found out the truth he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. As a result he also made the crow sacred and gave them the task of announcing important deaths. Apollo rescued the baby and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise. Phlegyas was irate and torched the Apollonian temple at Delphi and Apollo then killed him.

<h2> Homosexual relationships </h2>

Apollo, the eternal beardless youth himself, had the most male lovers of all the Greek gods, as could be expected from a god who was god of the palaestra, the athletic gathering place for youth, who all competed in the nude. Many of Apollo&apos;s young beloveds died &quot;accidentally&quot;, a reflection on the function of these myths as part of rites of passage, in which the youth died in order to be reborn as an adult.

<h3> Hyacinth </h3>

Hyacinth was one of his male lovers. Hyacinthus was a Spartan prince, beautiful and athletic. The pair were practicing throwing the discus when Hyacinthus was struck in the head by a discus blown off course by Zephyrus, who was jealous of Apollo and loved Hyacinthus as well. When Hyacinthus died, Apollo is said in some accounts to have been so filled with grief that he cursed his own immortality, wishing to join his lover in mortal death. Out of the blood of his slain lover Apollo created the hyacinth flower as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with άί άί, meaning alas. The Festival of Hyacinthus was a celebration of Sparta.

<h3> Acantha </h3>

One of his other liaisons was with Acantha, the spirit of the acanthus tree. Upon his death, he was transformed into a sun-loving herb by Apollo, and his bereaved sister, Acanthis, was turned into a thistle finch by the other gods.

<h3> Cyparissus </h3>

Another male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles. Apollo gave the boy a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo turned the sad boy into a cypress tree, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.

<h1> Apollo and the Birth of Hermes </h1>

Hermes was born on Mt. Cyllene in Arcadia. The story is told in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes. His mother, Maia, had been secretly impregnated by Zeus, in a secret affair. Maia wrapped the infant in blankets but Hermes escaped while she was asleep. Hermes ran to Thessaly, where Apollo was grazing his cattle. The infant Hermes stole a number of his cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow&apos;s intestines and the tortoise shell and made the first lyre. Apollo complained to Maia that her son had stolen his cattle, but Hermes had already replaced himself in the blankets she had wrapped him in, so Maia refused to believe Apollo&apos;s claim. Zeus intervened and, claiming to have seen the events, sided with Apollo. Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo, a god of music, fell in love with the instrument and offered to allow exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo became a master of the lyre and Hermes invented a kind of pipes-instrument called a syrinx.

Later, Apollo exchanged a caduceus for a syrinx from Hermes.

<h1> Other stories </h1>

<h2> Musical contests </h2>

<h3> Pan </h3>

Once Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo, and to challenge Apollo, the god of the lyre, to a trial of skill.  Tmolus, the mountain-god, was chosen to umpire.  Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present.  Then Apollo struck the strings of his lyre.  Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and all but Midas agreed with the judgment.  He dissented, and questioned the justice of the award.  Apollo would not suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.

<h3> Marsyas </h3>
The Flaying of Marsyas by Titian, c.1570-76.
Marsyas was a satyr who challenged Apollo to a contest of music. He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy. Marsyas lost and was flayed alive in a cave near Calaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. His blood turned into the river Marsyas.

<h2> Miscellaneous </h2>

When Zeus killed Asclepius for raising the dead and violating the natural order of things, Apollo killed the Cyclopes in response.  They had fashioned Zeus&apos; thunderbolts, which he used to kill Apollo&apos;s son, Asclepius.  Apollo also had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, his son, who committed suicide when he lost.

In the Odyssey, Odysseus and his surviving crew landed on an island sacred to Helios the sun god, where he kept sacred cattle. Though Odysseus warned his men not to (as Tiresias and kirke had told him), they killed and ate some of the cattle and Helios had Zeus destroy the ship and all the men save Odysseus.

Apollo killed the Aloadae when they attempted to storm Mt. Olympus.

Apollo gave the order, through the Oracle at Delphi, for Orestes to kill his mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus.  Orestes was punished fiercely by the Erinyes for this crime.

It was also said that Apollo rode on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months.

Apollo turned Cephissus into a sea monster.

The song describes the brain as being divided into two hemispheres, the left being the one dealing with emotion, and the right being the one dealing with rationality. Greek mythology is used to make these abstract notions tangible. The song appears of the 1978 album Hemispheres.

Andre Kirk Agassi, (born April 29 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada) is a former World No. 1 men&apos;s professional tennis player from the United States. He has won eight Grand Slam singles titles, and is one of only five players to have won all four Grand Slam events. He is considered to be among the all-time great tennis players.

<h1>Prodigy</h1>
Agassi&apos;s father, Mike Agassi, a former Olympic boxer, was intent on having a child win all four Grand Slams. He called Agassi&apos;s two older siblings &quot;guinea pigs&quot; in the development of his coaching techniques. He honed Agassi&apos;s eye-coordination when he was an infant by hanging tennis balls above his crib. He gave Agassi paddles and balloons when he was still in a high chair. When Agassi started playing tennis, his ball collection filled 60 garbage cans with 300 balls per can, and Agassi would hit 3,000-5,000 balls every day. When Andre was 5 years old, he was already practicing with pros such as Jimmy Connors and Roscoe Tanner.

Mike Agassi learned tennis by watching tapes of champions. He modelled each of Andre&apos;s shots out of the champion that hit that shot better than anyone else. He watched Boris Becker hit the ball on the rise and Ivan Lendl swing on the volley and he modelled Agassi&apos;s game after that. Mike Agassi took a very systematic approach to the physics and psychology of tennis, and still remains active in the sport. More information can be found in Mike Agassi&apos;s book, &quot;The Agassi Story.&quot;

<h1>Tennis career</h1>
<h2>1986-1997</h2>
Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of 16, and won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at Itaparica. He won six further tournaments in 1988, and by December that year he had surpassed US$2 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments – the quickest player in history to do so.

As a young up-and-coming player, Agassi embraced a rebel image. He grew his hair to rock-star length, sported an earring, and wore colorful shirts that pushed tennis&apos; still-strict sartorial boundaries. He boasted of a cheeseburger-heavy diet and endorsed the Canon Rebel camera. &quot;Image is everything&quot; was the ads&apos;s tag line, and it became Agassi&apos;s as well.

Strong performances on the tour meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. But he began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he lost in four sets to the seasoned veteran player Andrés Gómez. Later that year he lost in the final of the US Open to another up-and-coming teenaged star, Pete Sampras. The rivalry between the two American players was to become the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest the of the decade. In 1991, Agassi reached his second consecutive French Open final where he faced his former Bollettieri Academy-mate Jim Courier. Courier emerged the victor in a dramatic rain-interrupted five-set final.

Agassi chose not to play at Wimbledon from 1988-90, and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event&apos;s traditionalism, particularly its &quot;predominantly-white&quot; dress code which players at the event are required to conform to. Many observers at the time speculated that Agassi&apos;s real motivation was that his strong baseline game would not be suited to Wimbledon&apos;s grass court surface. He decided to play there in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about what he would wear   he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. He reached the quarter-finals on that occasion. To the surprise of many, Agassi&apos;s Grand Slam breakthrough came at Wimbledon in 1992 when he beat Goran Ivanišević in a tight five-set final.

Following wrist surgery in 1993, Agassi came back strongly in 1994 and captured the US Open, beating Michael Stich in the final. He then captured his first Australian Open title in 1995, beating Sampras in a four-set final. He won a career-high seven titles that year and he reached the World No. 1 ranking for the first time that April. He held it for 30 weeks on that occasion through to November. He compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hardcourt circuit, which ended when he lost in the US Open final to Sampras. In 1996, Agassi won the men&apos;s singles Gold Medal at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, beating Sergi Bruguera of Spain in straight sets in the final.

1997 was a poor year for Agassi. He won no top-level titles and his ranking sank to World No. 141 in November. His form was perhaps affected by the intense publicity surrounding his high-profile and turbulent relationship and marriage to actress Brooke Shields.

<h2>1998-present</h2>
In 1998, Agassi rededicated himself to tennis. He shaved his balding head, began a rigorous conditioning program, and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challenger Series tournaments (a circuit for professional players ranked outside the world&apos;s top 50). Perhaps most remarkably, the one-time rebel emerged as a gracious and thoughtful athlete, and looked up to by younger players. After winning matches, he took to bowing and blowing a two-handed kisses to spectators on each side of the court, a gesture seen as a rather humble acknowledgment of their support for him and for tennis.

In 1998, Agassi won five titles and lept from No. 122 on the rankings at the start of the year, to No. 6 at the end of it, making it the highest jump into the Top 10 made by any player in tennis. He won five titles in ten finals, and finished runner-up at the Miami Masters.

Agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he beat Andrei Medvedev in a five-set French Open final to become only the fifth male player to have won all four Grand Slam singles titles (a feat last achieved in the 1960s by Roy Emerson).  Agassi is the only player in history to win all 4 grand slams since the US and Australian open were altered to hard courts. He followed that up by reaching the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Sampras. He then won the US Open, beating Todd Martin in five sets in the final, and finished the year ranked the World No. 1.

Agassi began 2000 by capturing his second Australian Open title, beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in a four-set final. He was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand Slam finals since Rod Laver achieved the Grand Slam in 1969. 2000 also saw Agassi reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to Patrick Rafter in a very high quality battle considered by many to be one of the best matches ever played at Wimbledon . Agassi entered the year-end Tennis Masters Cup locked in a tight fight for the World No. 1 spot with Gustavo Kuerten and Marat Safin. Safin needed only three match wins in the tournament to become the year end number one.  However, Safin lost to Agassi in the semi-finals; Safin only won two matches. He was out of the running. Agassi then met Kuerten in the final, which would determine not only who would win the title but also who would finish the year as the No. 1 player. In the end it was Kuerten who emereged victorious with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 score. (Agassi won the tour&apos;s year-end championship once in 1990, and was runner-up in 1999, 2000 and 2003.)

Agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight-sets final win over Arnaud Clement. At Wimbledon, he battled Rafter again in the semi-finals and lost 8-6 in the fifth set. At the US Open he lost in the quarter-finals to Sampras in what is considered to be one of tournament&apos;s all-time greatest matches. Sampras won 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 in a match with no breaks of serve.

Agassi and Sampras&apos; last duel came in the final of the US Open in 2002. The battle between the two veterans saw Sampras emerge victorious in four sets, and left Sampras with a 20-14 edge in their 34 career meetings. (The match in fact proved to be the last of Sampras&apos; career. He did not play in an event on the professional tour again, and officially announced his retirement in 2003.) Agassi&apos;s US Open finish, along with his victories at the Miami Masters, Rome Masters, and Madrid Masters, helped him become the oldest year-end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.

In 2003, Agassi won the eighth Grand Slam title of his career at the Australian Open, where he beat Rainer Schüttler in straight sets in the final. On May 11, Agassi won the U.S. Men&apos;s Clay Court Championships in Houston, making him the oldest No. 1 ranked male tennis player in history at 33 years and 13 days.  He would hold the position for 13 weeks. At the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston, Agassi made it to the final, losing to Roger Federer, making him the oldest player to ever finish the year in the Top 5 (fourth) since Jimmy Connors finished fourth in 1987 when he was 35.

In 2004, the 34-year-old Agassi won the Tennis Masters Series event at Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles. In his run there, he beat players including Carlos Moya, Andy Roddick, and Lleyton Hewitt in the final, proving that he could still beat the world&apos;s top players. With strong finishes at the Australian Open (SF), Indian Wells Masters (SF), Cincinnati Masters (WON), US Open (QF), Madrid Masters (SF) and Stockholm Open (F), Agassi finished the year ranked eighth, making him the oldest player to finish the year in the Top 10 (at age 34) since Jimmy Connors finished seventh in 1988 when he was 36.

Agassi has also won one doubles title (at Cincinnati in 1993, partnering Petr Korda). He is one of only five male players to have won all the Grand Slams   along with legends Don Budge, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and Fred Perry. He is in fact the first male tennis player to win the four Grand Slams on four different surfaces. The previous players won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open on grass courts and the French Open on clay courts; whereas Agassi won the Australian Open on Rebound Ace, the French Open on clay, Wimbledon on grass, and the US Open on hardcourts. By winning the Olympic Gold Medal at the 1996 Olympics, Agassi became the first male tennis player to win the Career Golden Slam.  Agassi also helped the United States win the Davis Cup in 1990 and 1992. He was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1992. Agassi has earned more than US$30 million in prize-money throughout his career, second only to Sampras. In addition to this, he also earns over US$25 million a year through endorsements, the most by any tennis player and fourth in all sports (first place is Tiger Woods at US$70 million a year). In 2005, Agassi left Nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with Adidas.

Agassi started off 2005 with strong runs, most of which were cut short by Roger Federer. He lost to Federer in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open and the semifinals at Dubai. He reached the quarterfinals at Indian Wells after a dominant victory over Guillermo Coria, but withdrew from his match with Lleyton Hewitt with a swollen big toe. Agassi lost in the semifinals at Miami to Federer in a tight match. Although the claycourt season is the toughest on the body, Agassi played in Rome and reached the semifinals which he lost to Coria in a tough battle. At the 2005 French Open, Agassi lost to Jarkko Nieminem, withdrawing in the fifth set of their first-round match after enduring back pain related to a pinched sciatic nerve. After much media speculation about retirement, the 35-year-old Agassi won in Los Angeles and made the final at Montreal before falling to world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in three long sets that he might have won if a few points had gone differently. His coach Darren Cahill and close friend and personal trainer Gil Reyes worked with Agassi throughout the summer to prepare for the 2005 US Open. Agassi made a spectacular run at the Open, beating Razvan Sabau 6-3, 6-3, 6-1, Ivo Karlovic in the second round 7-6(7-4), 7-6(7-5), 7-6(7-4); Tomas Berdych 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(7-2); and Xavier Malisse 6-3, 6-4, 6-7(5-7), 4-6, 6-2. His quarterfinal match against fellow American James Blake has been called one of the best matches in US Open history. After dropping the first two sets, 3-6, 3-6, Agassi took the next two, 6-3, 6-3. In the fifth set, Blake served for the match at 5-4, but Agassi broke his serve, then won the tiebreak 8-6 to secure the victory at 1:15 a.m. He defeated Robby Ginepri, another rising, talented American with a consistent baseline game, in his third consecutive five-set match to earn a spot in the final against World No. 1 Roger Federer. After losing the first set 6-3, Agassi broke Federer twice to win the second, 6-2. He broke Federer again and at this point looked to be the better player. Agassi had a 30-love lead but with a few costly errors was broken to force a tiebreak, which Federer took, 7-1. Andre ran out of gas which allowed Federer to reel off five straight games.  Being down 5-0 in the fourth set, Agassi held to make it 5-1 before Federer closed it out to win the championship. After the match, Agassi thanked New York for the 20 years of memories, hinting at potential retirement. However, Agassi has made clear that he will only retire on his terms, when he feels that he cannot perform at his best on the court. He will likely continue for another year, as he has qualified for the 2005 Masters Cup (which is limited to the eight best players in the world) and is scheduled to play the lead-in tournament to the 2006 Australian Open.

Coming into the 2005 Masters Cup, Agassi is 29-5 on hard courts (with his only losses coming to Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal), and is 5-4 on clay (wins over Gasquet, Ljubicic, and Hrbaty, losses to Coria and Lopez).

<h1>Playing style</h1>
Agassi employs a baseline style of play, but unlike most baseliners who hit the ball behind the baseline, he typically makes contact with the ball inside the baseline. This is exceptionally difficult even for professionals, but Agassi&apos;s ability to hit a clean ball and his short backswing on his groundstrokes allow him to be able to do this. He also uses his short backswing to good advantage when returning the fast-paced serves of today&apos;s game - many observers agree that Agassi is the best service returner in the history of professional tennis.

Agassi&apos;s confirmation to play at the exhibition event at Kooyong just a week before the Australian Open gave Agassi fans hope that he will play for at least another year.

After his rededication to tennis in 1998, he has focused more on physical conditioning than in the past and is now one of the fittest players on the tour. One of his strategies is to wear down his opponents, continually putting pressure on them by returning the ball early and deep at angles. Agassi will stand in one spot and hit the corners while his opponent is left scrambling from side to side. He will often pass up the winner and hit a slightly less aggressive shot to make his opponent run a little more to retrieve a few more shots. His penchant for running players around point after point has earned him the nickname &quot;The Punisher&quot;.

<h1>Personal and family life</h1>
After a four-year courtship, Agassi married actress Brooke Shields in a lavish ceremony on April 19 1997. That February, they had filed suit against The National Enquirer claiming it printed &quot;false and fabricated&quot; statements: Brooke was undergoing counseling, binge-eating and taking pills; Agassi &quot;lashed into&quot; Brooke and he and Brooke&apos;s mother &quot;tangled like wildcats&quot; when she demanded a prenup; the case was dismissed. Agassi filed for divorce, which was granted on April 9, 1999.

By the time the divorce was final, Agassi was dating the German tennis legend Steffi Graf.  With only their mothers as witnesses, they were married at his home on October 22 2001. Their son, Jaden Gil, was born 6 weeks prematurely on October 26 that year. Their daughter, Jaz Elle, was born on October 3 2003.

In 1995, when Agassi&apos;s former brother-in-law, Pancho Gonzales, died broke and nearly friendless in Las Vegas, it was Andre Agassi who paid for his funeral.

<h1> Ethnicity question </h1>

Agassi&apos;s ethnicity, beyond being an American citizen, has been a subject of discussion by fans around the world. His father Mike Agassi is of Armenian and Assyrian ethnicity from the state of Iran, and there have been attempts to &quot;claim&quot; Agassi by both the Armenian and Iranian communities in the United States and abroad. Agassi has often seemed somewhat ambivalent, for example, joking after his &quot;All-Armenian&quot; match against Sargis Sargsian at the U.S. Open in 2004, &quot;Well, I&apos;m only half-Armenian&quot; , though he agreed to appear in a PBS documentary about  Armenian-Americans . His father has written in his book The Agassi Story about his experience of being an outsider in Muslim Iran, but Andre has also shown interest in the Iranian aspect of his heritage, in February 2005 expressing a desire to visit Iran, which holds &quot;a special place&quot; in his heart.

<h1>Quotes</h1>
About Pete Sampras&apos; retirement: &quot;You grow up with a guy, you compete against him for so long, he&apos;s such a big part of your career, something that&apos;s pretty special, so you do have that sense of personal regret that he&apos;s not around any more. You miss having that around.&quot;

During the 2005 US Open: &quot;I&apos;ve been motivated by overcoming challenge and overcoming the hurdles and obstacles that face me. There still is plenty out there to get motivated by.&quot;

The Austroasiatic languages are a large language family of Southeast Asia and India. The name comes from the Greek word for South Asia.

Austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. It is widely believed that the Austroasiatic languages are the autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia and eastern India, and that the other languages of the region, including the Indo European, Tai-Kadai, and Sino-Tibetan languages, are the result of later migrations of people. (There are, for example, Austroasiatic words in the Tibeto-Burman languages of eastern Nepal.) Some linguists have attempted to prove that Austroasiatic languages are related to Austronesian languages, thus forming the Austric superfamily.

Linguists traditionally recognize two major divisions of Austroasiatic, the Mon-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia and the Munda languages of east-central and central India. Ethnologue identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages, of which 147 are Mon-Khmer languages and 21 are Munda languages. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published, and it remains speculative.

Each of the subdivisions of the classification below that is written in boldface type is accepted as a valid family. However, the relationships between these families within Austroasiatic is debated. It should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review. The classification used here is that of Diffloth (in press), which does not accept traditional Mon-Khmer as a valid unit.

Map showing the distribution of Afro-Asiatic languages
The Afro-Asiatic languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout North Africa, East Africa, the Sahel, and Southwest Asia.  Other names sometimes given to this family include &quot;Afrasian&quot;, &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; (deprecated), &quot;Lisramic&quot; (Hodge 1972), &quot;Erythraean&quot; (Tucker 1966).

The following language subfamilies are included:

* Berber languages
* Chadic languages
* Egyptian languages
* Semitic languages
* Cushitic languages
* Beja language (subclassification controversial; widely classified as part of Cushitic)
* Omotic languages (controversial; sometimes argued to be outside Afro-Asiatic)

The Ongota language is often considered to be Afro-Asiatic, but its classification within the family remains controversial (partly for lack of data).  Harold Fleming tentatively suggests that it is an independent branch of non-Omotic Afro-Asiatic.

It is not generally agreed on where Proto-Afro-Asiatic was spoken; Africa (e.g., Igor Diakonoff, Lionel Bender) has often been suggested, particularly Ethiopia, because it includes the majority of the diversity of the Afro-Asiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity, often considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin. The western Red Sea coast and the Sahara have also been put forward (e.g., Christopher Ehret).  Alexander Militarev suggests that their homeland was in the Levant (specifically, he identifies them with the Natufian culture).

The Semitic languages are the only Afro-Asiatic subfamily based outside of Africa; however, in historical or near-historical times, some Semitic speakers crossed from South Arabia back into Ethiopia, so some modern Ethiopian languages (such as Amharic) are Semitic rather than belonging to the substrate Cushitic or Omotic groups.  (A minority of academics, e.g. A. Murtonen (1967), dispute this view, suggesting that Semitic may have originated in Ethiopia.)

Tonal languages are found in the Omotic, Chadic, and South &amp; East Cushitic branches of Afro-Asiatic, according to Ehret (1996). The Semitic, Berber and Egyptian branches are not tonal.

<h1>Common features and cognates</h1>

Common features of the Afro-Asiatic languages include:
*a two-gender system in the singular, with the feminine marked by the /t/ sound,
*VSO typology with SVO tendencies,
*a set of emphatic consonants, variously realized as glottalized, pharyngealized, or implosive, and
*a templatic morphology in which words inflect by internal changes as well as prefixes and suffixes.

Some cognates are:
*b-n- &quot;build&quot; (Ehret: *b n), attested in Chadic, Semitic (*bny), Cushitic (*m n/*m n &quot;house&quot;) and Omotic (Dime bin- &quot;build, create&quot;);
*m-t &quot;die&quot; (Ehret: *maaw), attested in Chadic (eg Hausa mutu), Egyptian (mwt, mt, Coptic mu), Berber (mmet, pr. yemmut), Semitic (*mwt), and Cushitic (Proto-Somali *umaaw/*-am-w(t)- &quot;die&quot;), also similar to the Latin mortis, indicating a possible vocabluary drift
*s-n &quot;know&quot;, attested in Chadic, Berber, and Egyptian;
*l-s &quot;tongue&quot; (Ehret: *lis&apos; &quot;to lick&quot;), attested in Semitic (*lasaan/lisaan), Egyptian (ns, Coptic las), Berber (ils), Chadic (eg Hausa harshe), and possibly Omotic (Dime lits&apos;- &quot;lick&quot;);
*s-m &quot;name&quot; (Ehret: *s m / *s m), attested in Semitic (*sm), Berber (ism), Chadic (eg Hausa suna), Cushitic, and Omotic (though the Berber form, ism, and the Omotic form, sunts, are sometimes argued to be Semitic loanwords.)  The Egyptian smi &quot;report, announce&quot; may also be cognate.
* d-m &quot;blood&quot; (Ehret: *dîm / *dâm), attested in Berber (idammen), Semitic (*dam), Chadic, and arguably Omotic.  Cushitic *dîm/*dâm, &quot;red&quot;, may be cognate.

In the verbal system, Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (including Beja) all provide evidence for a prefix conjugation:

A causative affix s is widespread (found in all its subfamilies), but is also found in other groups, such as the Niger-Congo languages.

The possessive pronoun suffixes are supported by Semitic, Berber, Cushitic (including Beja), and Chadic.

<h1>Classification history</h1>

Medieval scholars sometimes linked two or more branches of Afro-Asiatic together; already in the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian Judah ibn Quraysh of Tiaret, Algeria perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic (the latter being known to him through Arabic, Hebrew, and Aramaic.)

In the 1800&apos;s, Europeans began suggesting such relationships; thus in 1844 Th. Benfey suggested a language family containing Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter &quot;Ethiopic&quot;).  In the same year, T. N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.  The traditional &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; family was named by Friedrich Müller in 1876 in his Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft, and defined as consisting of a Semitic group plus a &quot;Hamitic&quot; group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; the Chadic group was not included.  These classifications were partly based on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. (See also Hamitic hypothesis.)

Leo Reinisch (1909) proposed to link Cushitic and Chadic, while urging a more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic, thus foreshadowing Greenberg; but his suggestion was largely ignored. Marcel Cohen (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct &quot;Hamitic&quot; subgroup, and included Hausa (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary.  Joseph Greenberg (1950) strongly confirmed Cohen&apos;s rejection of &quot;Hamitic&quot;, added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afro-Asiatic for the family; his classification of it came to be almost universally accepted.  In 1969, Harold Fleming proposed the recognition of Omotic as a fifth branch, rather than (as previously believed) a subgroup of Cushitic, and this has become generally accepted.  Several scholars, including Harold Fleming and Robert Hetzron, have since questioned the traditional inclusion of Beja in Cushitic, but this view has yet to gain general acceptance.

There is little agreement on the subclassification of the five or six branches mentioned; however, Christopher Ehret (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that Omotic was the first branch to split from the rest.  Otherwise, Ehret groups Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic together in a North Afro-Asiatic subgroup; Paul Newman (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic; Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or &quot;Erythraean&quot;, into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and everything else; he later added Semitic and Beja to the &apos;everything else&apos;, with Ongotá as a tentative third branch; and Lionel Bender (1997) advocates a &quot;Macro-Cushitic&quot; consisting of Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic, while regarding Chadic and Omotic as the most remote from the other branches.  Vladimir Orel and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic, Chadic with Egyptian, and split Cushitic into five or more independent subfamilies of Afro-Asiatic, seeing it as a Sprachbund rather than a valid subfamily.  Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of lexicostatistics, groups Berber with Chadic and both, more distantly, with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic.

The Principality of Andorra (Catalan: Principat d&apos;Andorra, French: Principauté d&apos;Andorre, Spanish: Principado de Andorra) is a small, landlocked principality in south-western Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by France and Spain. Once isolated, it is currently a prosperous country mainly because of tourism and its status as a tax haven.  Andorra is not to be confused with the Comune di Andora.

<h1> Origin and history of the name </h1>

The name &quot;Andorra&quot; probably originates from a Navarrese word andurrial, which translates as shrub-covered land.

<h1> History </h1>

Main article: History of Andorra

Tradition holds that Charlemagne granted a charter to the Andorran people in return for their fighting the Moors. Overlordship over the territory was passed to the local count of Urgell and eventually to the bishop of the diocese of Urgell. In the 11th century a dispute arose between the bishop and his northern French neighbour over Andorra.

In 1278, the conflict was resolved by the signing of a parage, which provided that Andorra&apos;s sovereignty be shared between the French count of Foix (whose title would ultimately transfer to the French head of state) and the bishop of La Seu d&apos;Urgell, in the Catalonia region of Spain. This gave the small principality its territory and political form.

Over the years the title passed to the kings of Navarre.  After Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, he issued an edict (1607) that established the head of the French state and the Bishop of Urgell as co-princes of Andorra.

In the period 1812–13, the French Empire annexed Catalonia and divided it in four departments. Andorra was also annexed and made part of the district of Puigcerdà (département of Sègre).

In 1933 France occupied Andorra as a result of social unrest before elections. On July 12, 1934, an adventurer named Boris Skossyreff issued a proclamation in Urgel, declaring himself Boris I, sovereign prince of Andorra, simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of Urgel. He was arrested by Spanish authorities on July 20 and ultimately expelled from Spain. From 1936 to 1940, a French detachment was garrisoned in Andorra to prevent influences of the Spanish Civil War and Franco&apos;s Spain.

In 1958 Andorra declared peace with Germany, having been forgotten on the Treaty of Versailles and remaining legally at war.

Given its relative isolation, Andorra has existed outside the mainstream of European history, with few ties to countries other than France and Spain. In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transportation and communications have removed the country from its isolation and its political system was thoroughly modernized in 1993.

<h1> Politics </h1>

Main articles: Politics of Andorra; Constitution of Andorra.

Until very recently, Andorra&apos;s political system had no clear division of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Ratified and approved in 1993, the constitution establishes Andorra as a sovereign parliamentary democracy that retains the co-princes as heads of state, but the head of government retains executive power. The two co-princes serve coequally with limited powers that do not include veto over government acts. They are represented in Andorra by a delegate.

View of the Pas de la Casa
The way in which the two princes are chosen makes Andorra one of the most politically distinct nations on earth. One co-Prince is the man or woman who is currently serving as President of France, currently Jacques Chirac (it has historically been any Head of State of France, including Kings and Emperors of France). The other is the current Catholic bishop of the Spanish city of La Seu d&apos;Urgell, currently Joan Enric Vives i Sicilia. As neither prince lives in Andorra their role is almost entirely ceremonial.

Andorra&apos;s main legislative body is the unicameral General Council of the Valleys (Consell General de les Valls), a parliament of 28 seats; members are elected by direct popular vote, 14 from a single national constituency and 14 to represent each of the 7 parishes, with members serving four-year terms. The Andorran government is formed by the General Council electing the Head of Government (Cap de Govern), who then appoints ministers to the cabinet, the Executive Council (Govern). Currently, government is held by the Liberal Party of Andorra, with Albert Pintat as Prime Minister. The Social Democratic Party (Andorra) is in opposition.

Defense of the country is the responsibility of France and Spain.

<h1> Administrative Divisions </h1>
Map of Andorra
Main article: Parishes of Andorra

Andorra consists of seven communities, known as parròquies (singular parròquia Engl.: parish)
*Andorra la Vella
*Canillo
*Encamp
*Escaldes-Engordany
*La Massana
*Ordino
*Sant Julià de Lòria

<h1> Geography </h1>
Main article: Geography of Andorra

Befitting its location in the eastern Pyrenees mountain range, Andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains of an average height of 1,996 m with the highest being the Coma Pedrosa at 2,946 m. These are dissected by three narrow valleys in a Y shape that combine into one as the main stream, the Valira river, leaves the country for Spain (at Andorra&apos;s lowest point of 870 m).

Andorra&apos;s climate is similar to its neighbours&apos; temperate climate, but its higher altitude means there is on average more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer.

<h1> Economy </h1>

190px

Main article: Economy of Andorra

Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra&apos;s tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra&apos;s duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra&apos;s comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of adjoining France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.

The banking sector, with its tax haven status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited – only 2% of the land is arable – and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is domestic sheep raising. Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.

Andorra is not a full member of the European Union, but enjoys a special relationship with it, for example it is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU member for agricultural products. Andorra lacks a currency of its own and uses that of its two surrounding nations. Prior to 1999 these were the French franc and the Spanish peseta, which have since been replaced by a single currency, the euro. Unlike other small European states that use the euro, Andorra does not yet mint its own euro coins; in October 2004, negotiations between Andorra and the EU began on an agreement which would allow Andorra to mint its own coins.

<h1> Demographics </h1>
Main article: Demographics of Andorra

Andorrans constitute a minority in their own country; only 33% of inhabitants hold Andorran nationality. The largest group of foreign nationals is that of Spaniards (43%), with Portuguese (11%) and French (7%) nationals the other main groups. The remaining 6% belong to several other nationalities.

The only official language is Catalan, the language of the nearby Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia, with which Andorra shares many cultural traits, though Spanish, Portuguese and French are also commonly spoken. The predominant religion is Roman Catholicism.

In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of all the members of the set divided by the number of items in the set (cardinality). (The word set is used perhaps somewhat loosely; for example, the number 3.8 could occur more than once in such a &quot;set&quot;.) The arithmetic mean is what pupils are taught very early to call the &quot;average.&quot; If the set is a statistical population, then we speak of the population mean. If the set is a statistical sample, we call the resulting statistic a sample mean.

The mean may be conceived of as an estimate of the median. When the mean is not an accurate estimate of the median, the set of numbers, or frequency distribution, is said to be skewed.

We denote the set of data by X = { x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n }. The symbol   (Greek: mu) is used to denote the arithmetic mean of a population. We use the name of the variable, X, with a horizontal bar over it as the symbol (&quot;X bar&quot;) for a sample mean. Both are computed in the same way:

: \bar{x}={\rm arithmetic\ mean}=(x_1+\cdots+x_n)/n.

The arithmetic mean is greatly influenced by outliers. For instance, reporting the &quot;average&quot; net worth in Redmond, Washington as the arithmetic mean of all annual net worths would yield a surprisingly high number because of Bill Gates. These distortions occur when the mean is different from the median, and the median is a superior alternative when that happens.

In certain situations, the arithmetic mean is the wrong concept of &quot;average&quot; altogether. For example, if a stock rose 10% in the first year, 30% in the second year and fell 10% in the third year, then it would be incorrect to report its &quot;average&quot; increase per year over this three year period as the arithmetic mean (10% + 30% + ( 10%))/3 = 10%; the correct average in this case is the geometric mean which yields an average increase per year of only 8.8%.

If X is a random variable, then the expected value of X can be seen as the long-term arithmetic mean that occurs on repeated measurements of X. This is the content of the law of large numbers. As a result, the sample mean is used to estimate unknown expected values.

Note that several other &quot;means&quot; have been defined, including the generalized mean, the generalized f-mean, the harmonic mean, the arithmetic-geometric mean, and the weighted mean.

<h1>Alternate notations</h1>
The arithmetic mean may also be expressed using the sum notation:

: \bar{x} = \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n x_i.

<h1>Pronunciation</h1>
When used as a noun, the word arithmetic is pronounced with the emphasis on the second syllable (aRITHmetic), but when used as an adjective, as in the title of this article, the emphasis is on the third syllable (arithMETic).

American Football Conference
The American Football Conference (or AFC) is one of the two conferences that compose the National Football League.  The AFC was formed before the 1970 NFL season from the American Football League when the AFL merged with the NFL.  It was agreed that the new conferences should be equal in number, and thus the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers were obliged to join the new AFC.  Initially, this proved to be very unpopular with fans in these cities.

The AFC currently consists of 16 teams, organized into four divisions (North, South, East, and West) of four teams each. Each team plays the other teams in their division twice (home &amp; away) during the regular season in addition to 10 other games/teams assigned to their schedule by the NFL in the May before.  2 of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams&apos; final record in the previous season.  The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions.  This assignment shifts each year.  For instance, in the 2005 regular season, each team in the NFC East will play a game apiece against each team in both the AFC West and the NFC West.  In this way division competition consists of common opponents, with the exception of the 2 games assigned on the strength of the each team&apos;s prior season record.

At the end of each football season, there are playoff games involving the top six teams in the AFC (the four division champions by place standing and the top two remaining non division champion teams (&quot;wildcards&quot;) by record). The two teams remaining play in the AFC Championship game with the winner receiving the Lamar Hunt Trophy. The AFC Champion plays the NFC Champion in the Super Bowl.

:For the Senior Al Gore, see Albert Gore, Sr.

Albert Arnold Gore Jr. (born March 31, 1948) is a former American politician and current businessman, who served as the 45th Vice President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He ran for President in 2000 following Bill Clinton&apos;s two four-year terms, but was narrowly defeated by the Republican candidate George W. Bush in a bitterly contested election that included multiple recounts and a Supreme Court decision that effectively decided the election in favor of Bush. While Gore received the most popular votes, the states Bush won gave him a majority in the U.S. Electoral College and Bush was elected President. The election remains one of the most divisive and controversial topics in recent American politics.

Gore currently serves as President of the American televison channel Current and Chairman of Generation Investment Management, sits on the board of directors of Apple Computer, and serves as an unofficial advisor to Google&apos;s senior management. Although speculation about a possible presidential run in 2008 still continues, he has repeatedly stated that he does not plan to return to politics.

<h1> Early and personal life </h1>
<h2> Family </h2>
Gore was born in Washington, DC to Albert A. Gore Sr. and Pauline LaFon Gore.  Since his father was a veteran Democratic senator from Tennessee, Al Gore Jr. divided his childhood between Washington, DC and Carthage, Tennessee.

During the school year, the younger Gore lived in a hotel in Washington, where he attended the Sheridan School, and later the elite St. Albans School; during summer vacations, he lived in Carthage, where he worked on the Gore family farm.

:For more information on Gore&apos;s academic records, see

In 1965, Gore enrolled at Harvard College, where he majored in government. His roommate (in Dunster House) was actor Tommy Lee Jones. Gore graduated from Harvard in June of 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

In 1970, Gore married Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson (Tipper Gore), whom he had first met many years before at his high school senior prom (St. Albans School in Washington, DC). They have four children: Karenna (born August 6, 1973), married to Drew Schiff; Kristin (born June 5, 1977); Sarah (born January 7, 1979); and Al III (born October 19, 1982). The Gores also have two grandchildren: Wyatt (born July 4, 1999) and Anna Schiff.

The Gores now reside in Nashville, Tennessee, USA, and own a small farm near Carthage, Tennessee.  The family attends New Salem Missionary Baptist Church in Carthage.

<h1>Vietnam War service</h1>
<h2>Vietnam and journalism</h2>

Although opposed to the Vietnam war, on August 7, 1969, Gore enrolled in the army to participate in the Vietnam War effort.  After completing training as a military journalist, Gore shipped to Vietnam in early 1971.  He served as an Army war correspondent until May 24 of that year, slightly less than two years after he enlisted.

: For more information on Gore&apos;s Vietnam service, see: , , , as well as further information below.

After returning from Vietnam, Gore spent five years as a reporter for the Tennessean, a newspaper headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee.  During this time, Gore also attended  Vanderbilt Divinity School and Law School, although he did not complete a degree at either, choosing instead to run for an open seat in Tennessee&apos;s 3rd Congressional District. Gore&apos;s mother was a member of Vanderbilt Law School&apos;s first class to accept women.

<h2> Military service </h2>

Gore served as a field reporter in Vietnam for five months.

Gore served in the Army from August 1969 to May 1971.  The chronology of his military service is as follows:
* August 1969: Enlisted at the Newark, New Jersey recruiting office.  
* August to October 1969: 8 weeks of basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey
* Late October 1969 to December 1970: Fort Rucker, Alabama, on-the-job occupational training at the Army Flier newspaper.
* January 1971 to May 1971: field reporter in Vietnam, part of the 20th Engineer Brigade, stationed primarily at Bien Hoa Air Base near Saigon.
* May 24, 1971: Discharged, after granting of routine early discharge request, as part of general troop reductions.

Gore stated many times that he opposed the Vietnam War, but chose to enlist anyway.  Some observers have noted that Gore could have avoided Vietnam in a number of ways.  Gore considered all these options, but said that his sense of civic duty compelled him to serve.  Some have suggested that Gore already foresaw that military service might be advantageous in his future career in politics.

Gore was not shipped immediately to Vietnam after completing basic training, spending most of his term in Fort Rucker. During the 2000 presidential election, some conservatives accused Al Gore of insufficient military service, because he was &quot;only&quot; a journalist and spent only five months in Vietnam, which some sources have characterized as &quot;less than half the standard 12 month Vietnam tour.&quot;  Although it is true that he was a journalist, Gore served in the Army only 75 fewer days than the standard two-year term (the entire 20th Engineers was to be deactivated and shipped home that fall).

Because Gore served as a journalist, he was never exposed to front-line combat. Although some allege that his famous father&apos;s influence helped him to obtain this position, most military analysts agree that any man who enlisted with a Harvard degree had a good chance of being assigned a support specialty rather than an infantry position (even at the war&apos;s height, 88% of all servicemen were assigned to noncombat specialties). However Gore&apos;s decision to enlist for a two year term did mean that he would not be able to select his assignment, a choice which was available to three year enlistees, and that he was technically at risk of a combat assignment even though in actuality the chances of such were infinitesimal. According to Newsweek journalist Bill Turque&apos;s biography Inventing Al Gore (which does not shy away from criticism and scandals, such as charging Gore with smoking marijuana far more frequently than he admits), 
:Dess Stokes, staff sergeant at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station on the day he walked in, doesn&apos;t remember any communication from superiors about Gore. A kid with Gore&apos;s background (a 134 IQ and a Harvard degree), he said, didn&apos;t need to be a senator&apos;s son with high-level contacts to get the military job he wanted.

Once in Vietnam, some also allege that Gore received special treatment as a former Senator&apos;s son (Gore Sr. lost the 1970 election, and was no longer a Senator by the time Gore arrived in Vietnam).  According to combat photographer H. Alan Leo, Gore was protected from dangerous situations at the request of Brigadier General Kenneth B. Cooper, the 20th Engineer Brigades Commander.  Leo stated that Gore&apos;s trips into the field were safe, and that Gore &quot;could have worn a tuxedo.&quot;  These remarks seem to contradict Gore&apos;s many public statements;

:&quot;I carried an M-16. I pulled my turn on the perimeter at night and walked through the elephant grass and I was fired upon.&quot;(Baltimore Sun)
:&quot;I took my turn regularly on the perimeter in these little firebases out in the boonies. Something would move, we&apos;d fire first and ask questions later.&quot; (Vanity Fair)
:&quot;I was shot at. I spent most of my time in the field.&quot; (Washington Post)
:&quot;I used to fly these things (combat helicopters) with the doors open, sitting on the ledge with our feet hanging down. If you flew low and fast, they wouldn&apos;t have as much time to shoot you.&quot;(Weekly Standard)

For his part, Gore has stated that he knew Leo but rarely traveled with him in Vietnam, and that he never felt that he was being given special protection.  On the other hand, Leo&apos;s testimony is that Cooper gave the orders before Gore arrived, so Gore would not know about them.  The question of whether Leo frequently traveled with Gore or not still has not been conclusively answered.

Turque&apos;s book, however, states that 
:&apos;&apos;[Cooper] said that he has no recollection of even meeting Leo, much less discussing Gore&apos;s safety with him. ...
:The evidence indicates that if there was an official effort to guarantee Gore&apos;s safety, it was uneven at best. His clippings from the Castle Courier, the newspaper of the U.S. Army Engineering Command, and other publications suggest that he pulled his weight, which in his case meant choppering around to report features about the good works of the 20th Engineers... When Smith said he was scheduled to leave for R&amp;R in Hawaii, the sergeant called for volunteers. Gore stepped up and spent a cold night in a foxhole. &quot;Al did what everybody else did,&quot; said Mike O&apos;Hara, the photographer who shot the Khe Sanh assignment...
:Regulations allowed for early release of personnel to teach or attend school if their services were deemed &quot;not essential to the mission,&quot; and Gore certainly qualified.

Gore stated in 1988 that his experience in Vietnam
:didn&apos;t change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of South Vietnamese who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for.

<h1>Early political career</h1>

Al Gore speaks during a congressional hearing in the 1980s.

In the spring of 1976, Gore quit law school to run for the U.S. House, in Tennessee&apos;s Fourth District.  Gore defeated Stanley Rogers in the Democratic primary, then ran unopposed and was elected to his first Congressional post.  He was re-elected three times, in 1978, 1980, and 1982.  In 1984 Gore did not run for the House; instead he successfully ran for a seat in the Senate, which had been vacated by Republican Majority Leader Howard Baker.  Gore served as a Senator from Tennessee until 1992, when he was elected Vice President.

In 1988, Gore ran for President but failed to obtain the Democratic nomination, which went instead to Michael Dukakis.

On April 3, 1989, Gore&apos;s six-year-old son Albert was nearly killed in an automobile accident while leaving the Baltimore Orioles opening game. Because of this and the resulting lengthy healing process, his father chose to stay near him during the recovery instead of laying the foundation for a presidential primary campaign against eventual nominee Bill Clinton. Gore started writing Earth in the Balance, his book on environmental conservation, during his son&apos;s recovery.   Earth in the Balance became the first book written by a sitting senator to make The New York Times best-seller list since John F. Kennedy&apos;s Profiles in Courage.

While in Congress, Gore was a member of the following committees: Armed Services (Defense Industry and Technology Projection Forces and Regional Defense; Strategic Forces and Nuclear Deterrence); Commerce, Science and Transportation (Communications; Consumer; Science, Technology and Space- chairman 1992; Surface Transportation; National Ocean Policy Study); Joint Committee on Printing; Joint Economic Committee; Rules and Administration.

<h1>Vice Presidency</h1>

Bill Clinton chose then-U.S. Senator Al Gore to be his running mate on July 9, 1992. After winning the U.S. presidential election, 1992, Al Gore was inaugurated as the 45th Vice President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Clinton and Gore were re-elected to a second term in the U.S. presidential election, 1996.

During his time as Vice President, Al Gore was mostly a behind the scenes player.  However, many experts consider him to be one of the most active and influential Vice Presidents in U.S. history.  One of Gore&apos;s major accomplishments as Vice President was the National Performance Review, which pointed out waste, fraud, and other abuse in the federal government and stressed the need for cutting the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations.  His book later helped guide President Clinton when he down sized the federal government.

In 1993 Gore debated Ross Perot on CNN&apos;s Larry King Live on the issue of free trade.  He is widely believed to have won the debate hands down, and public opinion polls taken after the debate showed that a majority of Americans agreed with his point of view and supported NAFTA.  Some claim that this performance may have been responsible for the passing of NAFTA in the House of Representatives, where it passed 234-200.

As Vice President, Gore instituted a federal program calling for all schools and libraries to be wired to the Internet. This was a culmination of work that he had started several years before. While serving in the Senate, Gore had introduced legislation which called for the creation of a new federal research center for educational computing to support an &quot;information systems highway&quot;.  This later served as the tenuous basis for mocking from his opponents that he&apos;d claimed to have &quot;invented the Internet&quot;.

During Gore&apos;s tenure as Vice President, he was a strong proponent for environmental protection. While a senator working on his book Earth in the Balance, Gore had traveled around the world on numerous fact finding missions. On Earth Day 1994, Gore launched the worldwide GLOBE program, an innovative hands-on, school-based education and science activity that made extensive use of the Internet to increase student awareness of their environment and contribute research data for scientists.
The insight he gained on issues such as global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer, and the destruction of rain forests is said to have played a major role in policy making for the Clinton administration. In the late nineties, Gore strongly pushed for the passage of the Kyoto Treaty, which called for reduction in green house emissions. ,

Because of President Clinton&apos;s inexperience and Gore&apos;s service in Vietnam and in the Senate, Clinton would often look to Gore for advice in the area of foreign policy.  Gore was one of the first to call for action to remove Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević from power in 1998.  Gore also supported Operation Desert Fox, the bombing campaign against Iraq in response to Saddam Hussein&apos;s unwillingness to cooperate with UN inspectors.

During the Clinton/Gore administration, Americans enjoyed eight years of relative peace along with the longest economic expansion in history. It is likely that the prosperity which occurred in the Clinton/Gore years is due to Alan Greenspan-endorsed Clinton and Gore&apos;s economic plan which limped through Congress without one Republican vote, and Vice President Gore casting the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Gore attributes the following economic achievements to his administration&apos;s economic plan:  :
Vice President Al Gore works along side President Clinton in trying to negotiate a Middle East peace plan with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
* More than 22 million new jobs
* Highest homeownership in American history
* Lowest unemployment in 30 years
* Paid off $360 billion of the national debt
* Lowest poverty rate in 20 years
* Higher incomes at all levels
* Converted the largest budget deficit, up to that time, in American history to the largest surplus
* Lowest government spending in three decades
* Lowest federal income tax burden in 35 years
* More families own stock than ever before

Upon the end of his tenure as Vice President, Gore was considered by some one of the most active, powerful, and popular Vice Presidents in US history.

<h1>2000 presidential election</h1>
Al Gore and running-mate Joe Lieberman at the 2000 Democratic National Convention.
After two terms as Vice President, Gore ran for President. In the Democratic primaries, Gore faced an early challenge from Bill Bradley. Bradley withdrew from the race in early March 2000 after Gore won every primary election. 
In August 2000, Gore surprised many when he selected United States Senator Joe Lieberman to be his vice-presidential running mate. Lieberman, who is claimed to be a more conservative Democrat than Gore, had publicly blasted President Clinton for the Monica Lewinsky affair. Many pundits saw Gore&apos;s choice of Lieberman as another way of trying to distance himself from the scandal-prone Clinton White House. Lieberman was also the first Jewish nominee on a major party&apos;s national ticket.
During the entire U.S. presidential election, 2000, Gore was neck and neck in the polls with Republican Governor of Texas George W. Bush.  On election day, the results were so close that the outcome of the race took over a month to resolve, highlighted by the premature declaration of a winner on election night, and an extremely close result in the state of Florida.

The race was ultimately decided by a razor thin margin of only 537 popular votes in Florida -- an astonishingly close margin out of some 105 million votes cast nationwide. Florida&apos;s 25 electoral votes were awarded to George W. Bush only after numerous court challenges. Al Gore publicly conceded the election after the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore voted 7 to 2 to declare the ongoing recount procedure unconstitutional, on the grounds that it was not being carried out statewide, and 5 to 4 to ban further recounts using other procedures.Al Gore makes a point during a presidential debate during the 2000 election as George W. Bush looks on. Gore strongly disagreed with the Court&apos;s decision, but decided that &quot;for the sake of our unity of the people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.&quot;  He had previously made a concession phone call to Bush the night of the election, but quickly retracted it after learning just how close the election was. Following the election, a subsequent recount conducted by various U.S. news media organizations indicated that Mr. Bush would have won using the partial recount method of 4 strongly Democratic areas advocated by Mr. Gore, but that Mr. Gore would have won given a full recount of the state. .

The Florida election has been closely scrutinized since the election. Several irregularities are thought to have favored Bush; others may have given Gore an edge. Irregularities on the Bush side included the notorious Palm Beach &quot;butterfly ballots&quot;, which produced an unexpectedly large number of votes for third-party candidate Patrick Buchanan, and a purge of some 50,000 alleged felons from the Florida voting rolls that included many voters who were eligible to vote under Florida law. Many Bush supporters, however, believed that an unfair advantage was given to Gore when all major news networks, early on, prematurely projected Gore as the winner of Florida&apos;s 25 electoral votes at 7:52 PM Eastern Time.  This happened before the polls closed in 10 small Florida counties in the heavily Republican western panhandle which are in the Central Time Zone, and thus closed at 7 PM Central Time (8 PM Eastern).  Some have thought that this depressed the pro-Bush vote in that area -- although none have shown any proof that voters who were at home and saw the networks call the election failed to go vote in the last 8 minutes.  During the numerous recounts (which made the phrase &quot;hanging chads&quot; infamous in the American vocabulary), there were also allegations of both pro-Bush and pro-Gore tampering by low-level operatives in the controversial counties.  It is unclear what effect, if any, this may have had.  And while the Gore camp, fought (with some success) to keep overseas absentee votes out in counties thought to be pro-Bush, Bush operatives similarly (albeit while drawing less attention to their efforts) prevented the counting of overseas absentee votes in strong Democratic counties.  Both sides contended that the votes were cast after election day, and since many of the envelopes did not have cancelled stamps, it was not clear when the votes were cast.  Reports later surfaced that many overseas voters attempted to vote only after learning of the closeness of the Florida vote.

Senator Hillary Clinton and President Clinton along with Vice President Gore and Tipper Gore at the White House on their last day in office.Some commentators still see such irregularities, and the legal maneuvering around the recounts as casting doubt on the legitimacy of the vote; as a matter of law, however, the issue was settled when the U.S. Congress accepted Florida&apos;s electoral delegation, only after a challenge to the Florida electors was presented in the congressional chambers on January 6, 2001 by members of the Congressional Black Caucus who could not secure the signature of one Senator to bring the challenge to a debate.

Concern about the possible disenfranchisement of voters in the Florida vote led to widespread calls for electoral reform in the United States, and ultimately to the passage of the Help America Vote Act, which authorized the United States federal government to provide funds to the states to replace their mechanical voting equipment with electronic voting equipment. However, this has led to new controversies, because of the security weaknesses of the computer systems, the lack of paper-based methods of secure verification, and the necessity to rely on the trustworthiness of the manufacturers whose employees also count those votes.
Although Gore won the nationwide popular vote by more than 500,000 votes, he lost the election by five electoral votes (with one DC Elector, pledged to Gore, casting a blank ballot to protest the District&apos;s lack of representation in Congress).

Gore lost his home state of Tennessee, making him the first presidential candidate since South Dakota Democratic Senator George McGovern in 1972 to lose his home state in a presidential election.

Joe Lieberman later criticized Al Gore for adopting a populist theme during their 2000 campaign. Lieberman said he objected to Gore&apos;s &quot;people vs. the powerful&quot; message, believing is that was not the best strategy for Democrats to use to recapture the White House.

While running for president in 2000, Al Gore was used as a voice actor for the television show Futurama. He played himself again in another episode after the campaign was over.

<h1> Post vice-presidency </h1>
<h2> Private citizen </h2>

Al Gore re-emerges in 2001 as a visiting professor with a beard.
Following his election loss, a bearded Gore accepted visiting professorships at Columbia University&apos;s Graduate School of Journalism, Middle Tennessee State University, University of California Los Angeles, and Fisk University. In late 2001, Al Gore became a Senior Advisor to Google and Vice Chairman of Los Angeles-based financial firm Metropolitan West Financial LLC.

On September 23, 2002 Gore spoke in San Francisco to The Commonwealth Club saying: &quot;We know that [Saddam] has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country. Iraq&apos;s search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as Saddam is in power&quot;

Following the November 5, 2002 midterm elections Gore re-emerged into the public eye with a 14-city book tour and a well-orchestrated &quot;full Gore&quot; media blitz which included a pair of policy speeches. On September 23, Gore delivered a speech on the impending War with Iraq and the War on Terrorism that generated a fair amount of commentary. Less than two weeks later, on October 2, he made a speech on Bush&apos;s handling of the economy to the Brookings Institution. Also, during this time period Gore guest starred on several programs such as The Late Show with David Letterman and Saturday Night Live, appearing much more relaxed and funnier as a private citizen than he did while holding public office.
Al Gore hosting Saturday Night Live along side West Wing stars Martin Sheen and John Spencer.
In 2003 Gore joined the board of directors of Apple Computer.  On the political front, Gore kept his promise of staying involved in public debate when he offered his criticism and advice to the Bush Administration on key topics such as the Occupation of Iraq, USA Patriot Act, and environmental issues, most notably global warming.  Gore also continued to visit campuses across the nation lecturing on issues such as race, media, and democracy.

On April 10, 2004, Gore met with the 9-11 Commission in private to give his testimony on what his administration did to prevent terror attacks. In a statement after the three-hour session, the commission said he was candid and forthcoming, and it thanked him for his &quot;continued cooperation.&quot;

In the summer of 2004, Gore teamed up with MoveOn.org, to promote the new scientific fiction film, The Day After Tomorrow.  Although Gore said the movie was a far-fetched example of global warming, he said the movie would escalate public debate on the issue.

On April 27, 2005, Gore gave an hour long speech lambasting the GOP&apos;s effort to do away with the legislative filibuster.  In response to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, who for weeks has repeated threats to impose the &quot;nuclear option&quot; if Senate Democrats did not stop blocking judicial nominees via the filibuster, Gore said, &quot;Their grand design is an all-powerful executive using a weakened legislature to fashion a compliant judiciary in its own image. The Senate has confirmed 205 or over 95 percent of President Bush&apos;s nominees.  Democrats have held up only 10 nominees, less than 5 percent. Compare that with the 60 Clinton nominees who were blocked by Republican obstruction between 1995 and 2000.  What is involved here is a power grab,&quot; Gore said.  Gore also took aim at what he called &quot;religious zealots&quot; who claim special knowledge of God s will in American politics.  He went on to say, &quot;They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against  people of faith.  How dare they!&quot;  This was Gore&apos;s first major policy speech of 2005 and also the first one since the defeat of Democratic hopeful John Kerry in late 2004.

In May 2005, Gore was awarded a lifetime achievement award for three decades of contributions to the Internet.  The Webby Awards, which are widely hailed as the Oscars of the web, &quot;wanted to set the record straight&quot; about Al Gore and the Internet once and for all.   Tiffany Shlain, the awards&apos; founder and chairwoman said, &quot;It&apos;s just one of those instances someone did amazing work for three decades as congressman, senator and vice president and it got spun around into this political mess,&quot; Shlain said.

In September 2005, Gore chartered two aircraft to evacuate 270 evacuees from New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  He was highly critical of the government and federal response in the days after the hurricane.

Speaking at an economic forum in Stockholm, Sweden in October 2005, Gore again stated that he has no intention of ever running for president again in response to questions from reporters.  However, Gore said he could not rule the possiblity out completely saying, &quot;I do not completely rule out some future interest, but I do not expect to have that.&quot; When asked how the U.S. would have been different if he had become president, Gore stated, &quot;We would not have invaded a country that didn&apos;t attack us,&quot; he said, referring to Iraq. &quot;We would not have taken money from the working families and given it to the most wealthy families.&quot; &quot;We would not be trying to control and intimidate the news media. We would not be routinely torturing people,&quot; Gore said.

In the past few years, Gore has remained busy traveling the world speaking and participating in events mainly aimed towards global warming awareness and prevention.

On May 4, 2004, INdTV Holdings, a company co-founded by Gore and Joel Hyatt, purchased cable news channel NewsWorld International from Vivendi Universal.  The new network will not have political leanings, Gore said, but will serve as an &quot;independent voice&quot; for a target audience of people between 18 and 34 &quot;who want to learn about the world in a voice they recognize and a view they recognize as their own.&quot; The network was relaunched under the name Current on August 1, 2005.

<h3> Investment firm </h3>

In late 2004, it was announced that Al Gore had launched and will chair an investment firm to seek out companies taking a responsible view on big global issues like climate change.

Gore&apos;s group, Generation Investment Management, was created to assist the growing demand for an investment style which can bring returns by blending traditional equity research with a focus on more intangible non-financial factors such as social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance.

<h2> 2004 presidential election </h2>

Al Gore shocked many when he did not endorse his 2000 running mate Joe Lieberman, but the outsider candidate, Howard Dean, in 2003.

Initially, Al Gore was touted as a logical opponent of George W. Bush in the 2004 United States Presidential Election. &quot;Re-elect Gore!&quot; was a common slogan among many Democrats who felt the former Vice President had been unfairly cheated out of the presidency, on the grounds that he had won the popular vote and (in the opinion of many) should have won the Electoral College vote. On December 16, 2002 however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004, saying that it was time for &quot;fresh faces&quot; and &quot;new ideas&quot; to emerge from the Democrats. When he appeared on a 60 Minutes interview, Gore said that he felt if he had run, the focus of the election would be the rematch rather than the issues. Gore&apos;s former running mate, Joe Lieberman quickly announced his own candidacy for the presidency, which he had vowed he would not do if Gore ran.

Despite Gore taking himself out of the race, a handful of his supporters formed a national campaign to &quot;draft&quot; him into running.  However, that effort largely came to an end when Gore publicly endorsed Vermont Governor Howard Dean (over his former running mate Joe Lieberman) weeks before the first primary of the election cycle. There was still some effort to encourage write-in votes for Gore in the primaries by a different group of Gore supporters who were separate from the draft movement. Although Gore did receive a small number of votes in New Hampshire and New Mexico, that effort was halted when John Kerry pulled into the lead for the nomination. Gore&apos;s endorsement of Dean was helpful to the latter in legitimizing him in the eyes of the establishment faction of the Democratic Party, but it also led the media to dub Dean as the clear front-runner, with the result that his opponents devoted more of their emphasis to opposing him.

On January 15, 2004, Al Gore gave a major policy address in New York City on climate change and the Bush administration&apos;s approach to the environment.  Accompanied by slides and projector, Gore slammed the Bush administration&apos;s attitude towards global warming saying, &quot;There are many who still do not believe that global warming is a problem at all. And it&apos;s no wonder: because they are the targets of a massive and well-organized campaign of disinformation lavishly funded by polluters who are determined to prevent any action to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming, out of a fear that their profits might be affected if they had to stop dumping so much pollution into the atmosphere.&quot;  (However, that day happened to be the coldest day in New York City history. The cold weather in New York helped make this speech especially controversial.)

On February 9, 2004, on the eve of the Tennessee primary, Gore gave what many consider his harshest criticism of the president yet when he accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. &quot;He betrayed this country!&quot; Mr. Gore shouted into the microphone.  &quot;He played on our fears. He took America on an ill-conceived foreign adventure dangerous to our troops, an adventure preordained and planned before 9/11 ever took place.&quot;  Gore also urged all Democrats to unite behind their eventual nominee proclaiming, &quot;any one of these candidates is far better than George W. Bush.&quot;  In March 2004 Gore, along with former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, united behind Kerry as the presumptive Democratic nominee.

Al Gore, who just four years prior accepted his party&apos;s nomination, speaks as a party elder at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.

On April 28, 2004, Gore announced that he would be donating $6 million to various Democratic Party groups.  Drawing from his funds left over from his 2000 presidential campaign, Gore pledged to donate $4 million to the Democratic National Committee. The party&apos;s Senate and House committees would each get $1 million, and the party from Gore&apos;s home state of Tennessee would receive $250,000. In addition, Gore announced that all of the surplus funds in his &quot;Recount Fund&quot; from the 2000 election controversy that resulted in the Supreme Court halting the counting of the ballots, a total of $240,000, will be donated to the Florida Democratic Party.

In his speech, Gore stressed the importance of voting and having every vote counted, a point that foreshadowed the 2004 U.S. election voting controversies.

On May 26, 2004, Gore gave a highly critical speech on the Iraq crisis and the Bush Administration.  In the speech, Gore demanded Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, and Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone all resign for encouraging policies that led to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners and fanned hatred of Americans abroad.  During the fiery speech, which lasted more than an hour, Gore called the Bush administration&apos;s Iraq war plan &quot;incompetent&quot; and called George W. Bush the most dishonest president since Richard Nixon, who resigned the office of the presidency in 1974 following the Watergate scandal.

Gore also decried the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq, saying, &quot;what happened at that prison, it is now clear, is not the result of random acts of a few bad apples. It was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy.&quot;

As the first major speaker at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Gore held himself out as a living reminder that every vote counts.  &quot;Let&apos;s make sure not only that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, but also that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court,&quot; said Gore.  Gore directed remarks to supporters of third-party presidential candidate Ralph Nader, who abandoned the Democratic Party four years ago, asking them, &quot;Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?&quot;

On October 18, 2004, Al Gore delivered his final major policy speech of the 2004 political season.  In an hour long presentation, Gore concluded that, &quot;I&apos;m convinced that most of the president&apos;s frequent departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with right-wing political and economic ideology than with the Bible.&quot;

<h1> Views and controversies </h1>
:Main article: Al Gore controversies

Al Gore&apos;s views are categorized as being those of a liberal. Gore is a strong supporter of abortion rights, free trade, and strong environmental policy. He was a vocal opponent of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, although he did voice support to the invasion as late as 2002 .
Though Gore has gradually moved politically further  left; he was once a moderate-to-conservative lawmaker. Early in his career, he was pro-life; his Congressional voting record was rated by the National Right to Life Committee as 84% anti-abortion.  Through the late 1980s, Gore maintained that abortion destroyed innocent human life. He had adopted a pro-choice position by 1988, when he sought the Democratic presidential nomination. Critics have called his change as stemming from political expedience rather than conviction.

Gore has also been involved in a number of controversies. His views on environmental policy have sometimes been cast as politically radical, especially during his 2000 presidential campaign.  His statement that he &quot;took the initiative in creating the Internet&quot; to describe his sponsorship of legislation to fund the commercialization of the internet has been ridiculed significantly by media, although the statement was defended by Internet pioneers such as Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf .  Additionally, conservatives charged Gore with illegal fundraising at a Buddhist temple and illegal use of his government office and telephone for political fundraising in violation of the Hatch Act, although he was never indicted on such a charge.

Animal Farm book cover

Animal Farm is a satirical novel (which can also be understood as a modern fable or allegory) by George Orwell, ostensibly about a group of animals who oust the humans from the farm they live on and run it themselves, only to have it corrupted into a brutal tyranny on its own. It was written during World War II and published in 1945, although it was not widely recognized until the late 1950s.

Animal Farm is a thinly veiled critique and satire of Communist totalitarianism. Many events in the book are based on ones from the Soviet Union during the Stalin era. (For example, the character Snowball, who is expelled from the Farm by Napoleon, is clearly modeled on Trotsky.)  George Orwell, though a left-winger - he was for many years a member of the Independent Labour Party - was a critic of Stalin, and suspicious of Moscow-directed communism after his experiences in the Spanish Civil War.

<h1> Plot </h1>
 Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.

The local prize-winning pig, Old Major, calls a meeting of all the animals of Manor Farm. He tells them that he has had a dream where mankind is gone, and animals are free to live in peace and harmony. He then proceeds to teach them a revolutionary song, &quot;Beasts of England&quot;. The other animals begin to hope and dream for the revolution of such a day. When Old Major dies a mere three days later, three pigs, Snowball (who teaches the animals to read, though how he learned to read is not clear), Napoleon, and Squealer assume command, and turn his dream into a full-fledged philosophy. The philosophy of Animalism has Seven Commandments, the first of which is that &quot;all animals are equal&quot;, and which are written on the wall of a barn for all to see. One night, the starved animals suddenly revolt and drive Mr. Jones, his wife, and his pet raven off the farm and take control. The farm is renamed &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as the animals work towards a future utopia, to which the workhorse Boxer does more than his fair share and adopts a maxim of his own - &quot;I will work harder.&quot;

It seems, at first, that Animal Farm is off to a great start. Snowball was teaching all of the animals to read and write, food was plentiful due to a good harvest, and the entire Farm was organized and running smoothly. Even when Mr. Jones tries his last-ditch effort to retake control of the farm, the animals are easily able to defeat him at the later called the &quot;Battle of the Cowshed&quot;. Soon, however, things begin to unravel as Napoleon and Snowball begin an epic power struggle over the farm. When Snowball announces his idea for a windmill, Napoleon quickly opposes it. A meeting is held, and when Snowball makes his passionate and articulate speech in favour of the windmill, Napoleon only makes a brief retort and then a strange noise (like a whistle). This noise signals the arrival of the nine puppies Napoleon had &quot;educated&quot;, who had grown into vicious attack dogs. They burst in and chase Snowball off of the farm. In his absence, Napoleon declares himself the leader of the farm and makes instant changes. He announces that meetings will no longer be held as before, and a committee of pigs alone would decide what happened with the farm.

Napoleon changes his mind about the windmill, claiming (through Squealer) that Snowball had stolen the idea, and the animals begin to work. After a violent storm, the animals wake to find the fruit of their labour utterly annihilated. Though neighbouring farmers scoff at the thin walls, Napoleon and Squealer convince everyone that Snowball destroyed it. Napoleon begins to purge the farm, killing many animals accused of consorting with Snowball. In the meantime, Boxer has taken a second mantra, &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot;.

Napoleon begins to abuse his powers even more and life on the farm becomes harder and harder for the rest of the animals. The pigs impose more and more controls on them while reserving privileges for themselves.  History is rewritten to villainise Snowball and glorify Napoleon even further. Each step of this development is justified by the pig Squealer, who on several occasions alters the Seven Commandments on the barn in the dead of night to justify the deeds until ultimately all that remains of the &quot;Principles of Animalism&quot; is that &quot;all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;. The song &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is banned as inappropriate now that the dream of Animal Farm has been realised, and is replaced by an anthem glorifying Napoleon who begins to live more and more like a human. The animals, though cold, starving, and overworked, remain convinced that they are still better off than when they were ruled by Jones.

Mr. Frederick, one of the two neighbouring farmers, swindles Napoleon by paying with forged banknotes (counterfeits), and then attacks the farm and uses dynamite to blow up the recently restored windmill. Though the animals of Animal Farm eventually win the battle, it comes at a great cost, as many of the animals, including Boxer, are wounded. However, Boxer continues to work harder and harder, until he finally collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to come and take Boxer to the veterinarian, but, as Boxer is loaded up and the van drives away, the animals read what is written on the side of the van: &quot;Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler.&quot; Squealer quickly reports that the van with the old writing had been purchased by the hospital, and that Boxer died in the hospital, in spite of the best medical care.

Many years pass, and the pigs have learned to walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments have been reduced to a single phrase: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&quot; Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs, and the humans of the area (in the adjacent Foxwood Farm run by Mr. Pilkington). He announces his alliance with the humans against the labouring classes of both worlds.

The animals discover this out by overhearing Napoleon&apos;s conversations and finally realize that a change had come over the ruling pigs. An argument breaks out between Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington over the simultaneous play of an Ace of Spades, and the animals realise how they cannot tell the difference between the pigs and the humans.

<h1>Plot References to Real Events</h1>
*Ousting of the Humans after the farmers forget to feed the animals – Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the removal of the Czars after a series of famine and poverty

*Mr. Jones’ last ditch effort to re-take the farm – Russian Civil War in which the western capitalist governments sent soldiers to try to remove the Bolsheviks from power

*Napoleon’s removal of Snowball – Stalin’s removal of Leon Trotsky from power in 1927 and his subsequent expulsion

*Napoleon stealing Snowball’s idea for a windmill – Stalin later shifted away from “Socialism in one country” to “World Socialism” which Trotsky had originally promoted

*During the rise of Napoleon, he ordered the collection of all the hens&apos; eggs. In an act of defiance, the Hens destroyed their eggs rather than give them to Napoleon - During Stalin&apos;s collectivization period in the early 1930s, many Ukrainian peasants burned their crops and farms rather than handing them over to the government.

*Napoleon’s mass executions, of which many were unfair for the alleged crimes - Stalin executed his political enemies for various crimes after they were tortured and forced to falsely confess

*Napoleon’s replacement of the farm anthem “Beasts of England” with “Comrade Napoleon”, which glorified him heavily – In 1943, Stalin replaced the old national anthem “the Internationale” with “the Hymn of the Soviet Union”. The old internationale glorified the revolution and &quot;the people.&quot; The original version of the Hymn of the Soviet Union glorified Stalin so heavily that after his death in 1953, entire sections of the anthem had to be replaced or removed.

*Napoleon’s dealing with Mr. Frederick, who eventually betrays Animal Farm and destroys the windmill. Though Animal Farm repels the human attack, many animals are wounded and killed – Stalin’s Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany in 1939, which was later betrayed in 1941 when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union. Though the Soviet Union won the war, it came at a tremendous price of roughly 20 million Soviet soldiers and civilians, as well as the utter destruction of the Western Soviet Union and its prized collective farms which Stalin had created in the 1930s.

*Napoleon’s later alliance with the humans – Stalin’s non-aggression pact with Hitler in the early years of WWII.

*Napoleon’s changing Animal Farm back to Manor – The Red Army’s name was changed from the &quot;Workers&apos; and Peasants&apos; Red Army&quot; to the &quot;Soviet Army&quot; to appear as a more appealing and professional organization rather than an army of the common people.

*Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington playing the Ace of Spades (note that the Ace of Spades is typically known as the highest card in a card deck) - The cold war ignited between the US and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies, which never actually resulted in a battle, but kept the world frightened for quite a while

*After Old Major dies, his skull is placed on display on a tree stump much like how Lenin&apos;s (whom Old Major is based on along with Karl Marx) embalmed body was put on display in Lenin&apos;s Tomb in Red Square postmortem.

<h1> Characters </h1>
The events and characters in Animal Farm are all carefully drawn to represent the history of the Soviet Union; Orwell makes this explicit in the case of Napoleon, whom he directly connects to Stalin in a letter of March 17 1945 to the publisher.

:..when the windmill is blown up, I wrote &apos;all the animals including Napoleon flung themselves on their faces&apos;.  I would like to alter it to &apos;all the animals except Napoleon&apos;.  If that has been printed it&apos;s not worth bothering about, but I just thought the alteration would be fair to J[oseph] S[talin], as he did stay in Moscow during the German advance.

The other characters have their analogies in the real world, but care should be taken with these comparisons as they do not always match history exactly and often simply represent generalised concepts.

<h2>The Pigs</h2>
*Napoleon - The pig who becomes the leader of Animal Farm post-Rebellion. Created based on the actions of Joseph Stalin, he uses his military (of nine attack dogs) to cement his power through fear. Napoleon craftily dispatches his opponent, Snowball.
*Snowball - The pig who fights Napoleon for control post-Rebellion. Inspired by Leon Trotsky, Snowball is a passionate intellectual and is far more upfront about his motives than Napoleon. Snowball easily wins the loyalty of most of the animals.
*Squealer - The pig who serves as public speaker. Inspired by Vyacheslav Molotov, Squealer twists and abuses the language to excuse, justify and extol Napoleon&apos;s actions, no matter how egregious. All his life, George Orwell made it a point to show how politicians used language. Squealer limits the debate by complicating it, and he confuses and disorients, making claims that the pigs need the extra luxury they are taking in order to function properly. To squeal is to betray, something Squealer does often to his fellow animals.
*Minimus - A poet pig who writes a song about Napoleon, representing admirers of Stalin both inside and outside the USSR such as Maxim Gorky.
*Old Major - As a fellow socialist, Orwell agreed with Karl Marx&apos;s politics, and even respected Vladimir Lenin. In fact, the satire in Animal Farm is not of Marxism, or Lenin&apos;s revolution, but of the corruption that occurred later. Major, who is based upon both Lenin and Marx, is the inspiration which fuels the rest of the book. Though it is a positive image, Orwell does slip some flaws in Old Major, such as how during his complaints about the abuse of animals he admits that he has been largely free from those terrors.

<h2>The Humans</h2>
*Mr. Jones - The original owner of Manor Farm. He is probably based on Tsar (Czar) Nicholas II.
*Mr. Frederick- The tough owner of Pinchfield, a well-kept neighbouring farm. He is probably based on Germany and/or Adolf Hitler.
*Mr. Pilkington - The easy-going but crafty owner of Foxwood, a neighbouring farm. He represents Britain and/or Winston Churchill.
*Mr. Whymper - A human who Napoleon hires to represent Animal Farm in human society. He is loosely based on George Bernard Shaw who visited the USSR in 1931 and praised what he found.

<h2>The Other Animals</h2>
*Boxer - Possibly one of the more popular characters, Boxer is the avatar of the working class: Loyal, dedicated, and strong. His major flaw, however, is his blind trust of the leaders and his inability to see corruption. He is used and abused by the pigs as much or more than he was by Jones. His death serves to show just how far the pigs are willing to go. It is worth noting that prior to his death, Boxer played a huge part in keeping the Farm together. Boxer could also represent a Stakhanovite.
*Clover - Boxer&apos;s close friend. She blames herself for forgetting the complete Seven Commandments when Squealer revises them. She represents the common people who acquiesce to the subversion of principles by the powerful.
*Mollie - A horse who likes wearing ribbons (which represent luxury) and being pampered by humans. She represents upper-class people, the Bourgeoisie who fled from the U.S.S.R after the Russian Revolution.
*Benjamin - A donkey who is cynical about the revolution. He is said to be inspired by Orwell himself.
*Moses - A tame raven who spreads stories of Sugarcandy Mountain, the &quot;animal heaven&quot;. These beliefs are denounced by the pigs. Moses represents religion, which has always been in conflict with communism.  
*Muriel - A goat who reads the edited commandments. She may represent intelligent labour.
*Jesse and Bluebell - Two dogs who give birth in Chapter III. Their puppies are nurtured by Napoleon to inspire fear, without doubt representing the formation of the NKVD/KGB.
*The Hens - Represent the Kulaks, landed peasants persecuted by Stalin.

<h1> Significance</h1>
The book is an allegory about the events following the revolution in the Soviet Union, and in particular the rise of Stalinism and the betrayal of the revolution which basically replaced one dictatorship for another. Many of the characters in the book are identifiable as historical figures. Napoleon and Snowball are direct representations of Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky respectively. Their disagreement about the direction the farm should take is meant to represent the ideological power struggle between Trotsky and Stalin. Boxer, the ever-loyal cart horse, portrays the ill-educated and unskilled proletariat. Boxer and the other cart-horse, Clover, are manipulated by the persuasive arguments of the pigs but are ultimately taken for granted and fail to reap the benefits of the &quot;Revolution&quot;. Comparisons can be drawn between Boxer and Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov, after whom the Stakhanovite movement was named.

Orwell wrote the book following his experiences during the Spanish Civil War which are described in another of his books, Homage to Catalonia.  He intended it to be a strong condemnation of what he saw as the Stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals, in which he believed and continued to believe after he saw a revolution betrayed, as in Spain.  For the preface of a Ukrainian edition he prepared in 1947, Orwell describes what gave him the idea of setting the book on a farm.

:..I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge cart-horse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.

This Ukrainian edition was an early propaganda use of the book.  It was printed to be distributed among the soviet citizens of Ukraine who were just some of the many millions of displaced persons throughout Europe at the end of the Second World War.  The American occupation forces did not appreciate these illegal presses, printing propaganda, and confiscated 1,500 copies of Animal Farm, handing them to the Soviet authorities.  The politics in the book also affected Britain, with Orwell reporting that Ernest Bevin was &quot;terrified&quot;  [  #endnote_Bevin]   that it may cause embarrassment if published before the 1945 general election.

In recent years the book has been used to compare new movements that overthrow heads of a corrupt and undemocratic government or organization, only to become corrupt and oppressive themselves over time as they succumb to the trappings of power and begin using violent and dictatorial methods to keep it. Such analogies have been used for many former African colonies such as Zimbabwe and Democratic Republic of Congo, whose succeeding African-born rulers were thought to be as corrupt as the European colonists they supplanted.

<h1> References and post-publication views of the book </h1>

:In the post-War years, apparently anti-Russian literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch - including his regular publisher Gollancz. One publisher he sought to sell his book to rejected it on the grounds of government advice - although it was later found that the civil servant who gave the order was a Soviet spy.
::(Source: Orwell: The Life, D.J. Taylor, 2003, ISBN 0-8050-7473-2)

Orwell originally prepared  a preface on freedom of the press for the book which noted &quot;The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary. ... [Things are] kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that  it wouldn t do  to mention that particular fact.&quot; Somewhat ironically, the preface itself was censored and is not published with most copies of the book.

The book was the basis of an animated feature film in 1955 (Britain&apos;s first full-length animated movie), directed by John Halas and Joy Batchelor and quietly commissioned by the American CIA, which softened the theme of the story slightly by reducing the role of Moses, the character representing religion, and adding an epilogue where the other animals successfully revolt against the pigs.  There was also a 1999 live action film directed by John Stephenson, with voices by Kelsey Grammer as Snowball, Patrick Stewart as Napoleon, and Ian Holm as Squealer. Despite a few differences (such as completely different songs and Jesse being the first to question the pigs), much of the plot is loyal to the book. The film diverges from the book with an additional epilogue in which Jesse and several animals escape and return years later to a post-Napoleon era Animal Farm. In addition, radical socialist rappers Dead Prez released a song called &quot;Animal in Man&quot; off their debut LP, Let&apos;s Get Free, re-telling the story.

Pink Floyd&apos;s 1977 album Animals was partially inspired by Animal Farm. It categorises people as either pigs, dogs or sheep.

Amphibians (class Amphibia) are a taxon of animals that include all tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates) that do not have amniotic eggs. Amphibians (from Greek αμφις &quot;both&quot; and βιος &quot;life&quot;) generally spend part of their time on land, but they do not have the adaptations to an entirely terrestrial existence found in most other modern tetrapods (amniotes). There are about 5,700 living species of amphibians. The study of amphibians and reptiles is known as herpetology. The fear of amphibians and reptiles is known as herpetophobia.

<h1> History of amphibians </h1>
Amphibians developed with the characteristics of pharyngeal slits/gills, a dorsal nerve cord, a notochord, and a post-anal tail at different stages of their life. They have persisted since the dawn of tetrapods 390 million years ago in the Devonian period, when they were the first four-legged animals to develop lungs. During the following Carboniferous period they also developed the ability to walk on land to avoid aquatic competition and predation while allowing them to travel from water source to water source. As a group they maintained the status of the dominant animal for nearly 75 million years. Throughout their history they have ranged in size from the 3 foot long Devonian Ichthyostega, to the slightly larger 5 foot long Permian Eryops, and down to the tiny Brachycephalus didactylus (Brazilian Gold Frog) and Eleutherodactylus iberia from Cuba, with a total length of 9.6-9.8 millimeters. Amphibians have mastered almost every climate on earth from the hottest deserts to the frozen arctic, and have adapted to climatic change with ease.

<h1> Classification </h1>
Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes.  Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia.  Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.

There are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:

* Subclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic)
* Subclass Lepospondyli

Of the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:

* Order Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,070 species
* Order Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 510 species
* Order Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 170 species

Authorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti.  Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now.

<h1> Reproduction </h1>
For the purpose of reproduction most amphibians are bound to fresh water. A few tolerate brackish water, but there are no true sea water amphibians. Several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations (e.g., Eleutherodactylus, the Pacific Platymantines, the Australo-Papuan microhylids, and many other tropical frogs), however, do not need any water whatsoever.  They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water.  Almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, bypassing the tadpole stage entirely. Several species have also adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, but most of them still need water to lay their eggs. The larvae (tadpoles or polliwogs) breathe with exterior gills. After hatching, they start to transform gradually into the adult&apos;s appearance. This process is called metamorphosis. Typically, the animals then leave the water and become terrestrial adults, but
there are many interesting exceptions to this general way of reproduction.

The most obvious part of the amphibian metamorphosis is the formation of four legs in order to support the body on land. But there are several other changes:
* The gills are replaced by other respiratory organs, e.g. lungs.
* The skin changes and develops glands to avoid dehydration
* The eyes get eyelids and adapt to vision outside the water
* An eardrum is developed to lock the middle ear
* In frogs and toads, the tail disappears

Alaska is the 49th state of the United States. It was admitted on January 3, 1959, The population of the state is 626,932, as of 2000, according to the census. The name &quot;Alaska&quot; is most likely derived from the Aleut word Alyeska, meaning greater land. as opposed the Aleut word Aleutia, meaning lesser land. To the Aleuts, this distinction was a linguistic variation distinguishing the mainland from an island.

It is bordered by Yukon Territory and British Columbia, Canada to the east, the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south, the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west, and the Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska is the largest state by area in the United States. It is larger in area than all but 18 of the world&apos;s nations.

<h1>History</h1>

Main article: History of Alaska

Alaska was probably first inhabited by humans who came across the Bering Land Bridge.  Eventually, Alaska became populated by the Inupiaq, Inuit and Yupik Eskimos, Aleuts, and a variety of American Indian groups. Most, if not all, of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas probably took this route and continued further south and east.

The first written accounts indicate that the first Europeans to reach Alaska came from Russia. Vitus Bering sailed east and saw Mt. St. Elias.  The Russian-American Company hunted sea otters for their fur.  The colony was never very profitable, because of the costs of transportation.

At the instigation of U.S. Secretary of State William Seward, the United States Senate approved the purchase of Alaska from Russia for $7,200,000 (approximately $90,750,000 in 2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) on 9 April 1867, and the United States flag was raised on October 18 of that same year (now called Alaska Day). Coincident with the ownership change, the de facto International Date Line was moved westward, and Alaska changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, for residents, Friday, October 6, 1867 was followed by Friday, October 18, 1867; two Fridays in a row because of the date line shift.

The first American administrator of Alaska was Polish immigrant Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski. The purchase was not popular in the contiguous United States, where Alaska became known as &quot;Seward&apos;s Folly&quot; or &quot;Seward&apos;s Icebox.&quot;  Alaska celebrates the purchase each year on the last Monday of March, calling it Seward&apos;s Day. After the purchase of Alaska between 1867 and 1884 the name was changed to the Department of Alaska.  Between 1884 and 1912 it was called the district of Alaska.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Act into United States law on 7 July 1958 which paved the way for Alaska&apos;s admission into the Union on January 3, 1959.

Alaska suffered one of the worst earthquakes in recorded North American history on Good Friday 1964 (see Good Friday Earthquake).

In 1976, the people of Alaska amended the state&apos;s constitution, establishing the Alaska Permanent Fund. The fund invests a portion of the state&apos;s mineral revenue, including revenue from the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline System, &quot;to benefit all generations of Alaskans.&quot; In March 2005, the fund&apos;s value was over $30 billion.

Prior to 1983, the state lay across four different time zones Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8 hours) in the extreme southeast, a small area of Yukon Standard Time (UTC -9 hours) around Juneau, Alaska Hawaii Standard Time (UTC -10 hours) in the Anchorage and Fairbanks vicinity, with the Nome area and most of the Aleutian Islands observing Bering Standard Time (UTC -11 hours).  In 1983 the number of time zones was reduced to two, with the entire mainland plus the inner Aleutian Islands going to UTC -9 hours (and this zone then being renamed Alaska Standard Time as the Yukon Territory had several years earlier (circa 1975) adopted a single time zone identical to Pacific Standard Time), and the remaining Aleutian Islands were slotted into the UTC  10 hours zone, which was then renamed Hawaii Aleutian Standard Time.

Over the years various vessels have been named USS Alaska, in honor of the state.

During World War II three of the outer Aleutian Islands Attu, Agattu and Kiska were occupied by Japanese troops. It was the only part of the United States to have land occupied during the war.

<h1>Politics</h1>

Alaska is often characterized as a hybrid Republican state with strong Libertarian leanings. Local political communities often work on issues related to land use development, fishing, tourism, and individual rights as many residents are proud of their rough Alaskan heritage.

Alaska Natives, while organized in and around their communities, are often active within the Native corporations which have been given ownership over large tracts of land, and thus need to deliberate resource conservation and development issues.

In presidential elections, the state&apos;s Electoral College votes have been most often won by a Republican nominee. Only once has Alaska supported a Democrat nominee (Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964), although the 1960 and 1968 elections were close and Alaska was considered a swing state in those elections.  President George W. Bush won the state&apos;s electoral votes in 2004 by a margin of 25 percentage points with 61.1% of the vote.  Juneau stands out as an area that supports Democratic candidates.

When Congress, in 1957 and 1958, debated the wisdom of admitting it as the 49th state, much of the political debate centered on whether Alaska would become a Democratic or Republican-leaning state. Conventional wisdom had it that, with its rugged individualism, penchant for new ideas, and dependence on the Federal Government largess for basic needs, it would become a Democratic stronghold, about which Republicans (and the, then, Republican Administration of Dwight Eisenhower) had reservations.  Given time, those fears proved roundly unfounded.  After an early flirtatious period with liberal politics, the political climate of Alaska changed quickly once oil was discovered and Federal government &apos;dependence&apos; was seen as &apos;meddling&apos; in local affairs.

In recent years, the Alaska Legislature (20-member Senate serving 4-year terms and 40-member House serving 2-year terms) has been dominated by conservative, mostly Republican Party, members.  Likewise, recent state governors have been mostly conservatives, although not always elected under the official &apos;Party&apos; banner. Republican Wally Hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after jumping the Republican ship and briefly joining the Alaskan Independence Party ticket just long enough to get elected.  He subsequently officially &apos;rejoined&apos; the Republican fold in 1994.

Alaska&apos;s members of the U.S. Congress are all Republican.  U.S. Senator (some political wits call him Senator-For-Life) Ted Stevens was appointed to the position following the death of U.S. Senator Bob Bartlett in December of 1968, and has never lost a re-election campaign since. Until his resignation from the U.S. Senate to run for State Governor, Republican Frank Murkowski held the state&apos;s other Senatorial position and, as Governor, was allowed to appoint his daughter, Lisa Murkowski as his successor.  She won a full six-year term on her own in 2004.

Alaska&apos;s sole U.S. House Representative, Don Young won re-election to his 17th-straight term, also in 2004.  His seniority in House ranks him as one of the most influential Republican House members.  His position on the House Transportation Committee allowed him to parlay some $450 million to two bridge projects in Alaska, for which he gained national notoriety following the devastation in the State of Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina and his insistence that those monies not be returned to aide in rebuilding the Gulf Coast.

<h1> Geography </h1>
Alaska is the only state that is both in North America and not part of the 48 contiguous states; about 500 miles (800 kilometers) of Canadian territory separate Alaska from Washington. (It is thus an exclave.) It is also the only state in which the majority of citizenry must pass through a foreign country when driving to its Capital City.

Alaska is the largest state in the United States in terms of land area, 570,374 square miles (1,477,261 km²).  If a map of Alaska were superimposed upon a map of the lower 48 states, Alaska would overlap Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and Colorado.

One scheme for describing the state&apos;s geography is by labeling the regions:
*South Central Alaska is the southern coastal region and is the population center for the state. The Municipality of Anchorage and many small but growing towns (Palmer, Wasilla, etc.) lie within this area.  Petroleum industrial plants, transportation, tourism, and two military bases form the core of the economy here.
*The Alaska Panhandle, also known as Southeast Alaska, is home to Juneau, many small towns, tidewater glaciers and extensive forests.  Tourism, forestry and state government anchor the economy.
*The Alaska Interior is home to Fairbanks.  The geography is marked by large braided rivers, such as the Yukon River and the Kuskokwim River, as well as Arctic tundra lands and shorelines. 
*The Alaskan Bush is the remote, less crowded part of the state, encompassing 380 native villages and small towns such as Nome, Bethel, Kotzebue and, most famously, Barrow, the northernmost point on the North American continent.

With its numerous islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (54,700 km) of tidal shoreline. The island chain extending west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula is called the Aleutian Islands. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians.  For example, Unimak Island is home to Mount Shishaldin, a moderately active volcano that rises to 9,980 ft (3,042 m) above sea level.  The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland.

North America&apos;s second largest tides occur in Turnagain Arm just south of Anchorage, which often sees tidal differences of more than 35 feet.

Alaska is also wet in other ways.  While Minnesota may be famous for its ten-thousand lakes, Alaska is home to three-and-a-half million such lakes, just counting those 20-acres in size or larger. Marshlands and wetland permafrost comprise another sizable chunk of the state, collectively covering 188,320 square miles, mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands.  Frozen water, in the form of glacier ice, covers still more: some 16-thousand square miles of land and 1200 square miles of tidal zone.  One, the Bering Glacier complex near the southeastern border with Yukon, Canada, covers 2250 square miles alone.

Alaska is the westernmost state in the union. The Aleutian Islands actually cross longitude 180°, also making it the easternmost state, although the International Date Line doglegs around them to keep the whole state in the same day. (see: Extreme points of the United States)

According to the October 1998 report of the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. Federal Government as national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges. Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87 million acres (350,000 km²), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

Of the remaining land area, the State of Alaska owns 24.5%; another 10% is managed by thirteen regional and dozens of local Native corporations created under ANCSA. Various private interests own the remaining land, totaling less than 1%.

<h1>Boroughs and census areas</h1>
Alaska has no counties in the sense used in the rest of the country. Instead, the state is divided into 27 census areas and boroughs.  The difference between boroughs and census areas is that boroughs have an organized area-wide government, while census areas are artificial divisions defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only.  Areas of the state not in organized boroughs compose what the government of Alaska calls the unorganized borough. Borough-level government services in the unorganized borough are provided by the state itself.

<h1>Economy</h1>
The state&apos;s 2003 total gross state product was $31 billion. Its per-capita income for 2003 was $33,213, 14 th  in the nation. Alaska&apos;s main export is seafood. Agriculture represents only a fraction of the Alaska economy.  Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere. Employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation.  Military bases are a significant component of the economy in both Fairbanks and Anchorage.  Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector.

The cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. This has changed for the most part in Anchorage and Fairbanks, where the cost of living is actually less than some major cities in the Lower 48, thanks to lower housing and transportation costs. The introduction of big-box stores in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and Juneau also did much to lower prices.  However, rural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods, compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure. Many rural residents come in to these cities and purchase food and goods in bulk from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam&apos;s Club. Some have embraced the free shipping offers of some online retailers to purchase items much more cheaply than they could in their own communities, if they are available at all.

<h1>Transportation</h1>
Alaska is arguably the least-connected state in terms of road transportation. The state&apos;s road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the Alaska Highway, the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system. One unique feature of the road system is the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel, which links the Seward Highway south of Anchorage with the relatively isolated community of Whittier. The tunnel is the longest road tunnel in North America at nearly 2.5 miles and combines a one-lane roadway and train tracks in the same housing. Consequently, eastbound traffic, westbound traffic, and the Alaska Railroad must share the tunnel, resulting in waits of 20 minutes or more to enter.

The Alaska Railroad runs from Seward through Anchorage, Denali, and Fairbanks to North Pole, with spurs to Whittier and Palmer. The railroad is famous for its summertime passenger services but also plays a vital part in moving Alaska&apos;s natural resources, such as coal and gravel, to ports in Anchorage, Whittier and Seward. The Alaska Railroad is the only remaining railroad in North America to use cabooses on its freight trains. The route between Talkeetna and Hurricane (an area between Talkeetna and Denali) features the last remaining flag stop train service in the United States. A stretch of the track along an area inaccessible by road serves as the only transportation to cabins in the area. Residents board the train in Talkeetna and tell the conductor where they want to get off. When they want to come back to town, they wait by the side of the tracks and &quot;flag&quot; the train, giving the train its name.

Most cities and villages in the state are accessible only by sea or air. Alaska has a well-developed ferry system, known as the Alaska Marine Highway, which serves the cities of Southeast and the Alaska Peninsula. The system also operates a ferry service from Bellingham, Washington up the Inside Passage to Haines (several cruise companies offer cruises up the Inside Passage as well, with service all the way to Seward and Whittier). Cities not served by road or sea can only be reached by air, accounting for Alaska&apos;s extremely well-developed Bush air services an Alaskan novelty.

Anchorage itself, and to a lesser extent Fairbanks, are serviced by many major airlines. Air travel is the cheapest and most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state. Anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism (unofficial sources have estimated the numbers for 2004 at some four million tourists arriving in Alaska between May and September).

However, regular flights to most villages and towns within the state are commercially challenging to provide. Alaska Airlines is the only major airline offering in-state travel with jet service (sometimes in combination cargo and passenger Boeing 737-200s) from Anchorage and Fairbanks to regional hubs like Bethel, Nome, Kotzebue, Dillingham, Kodiak, and other larger communities as well as to major Southeast and Alaska Peninsula communities. The bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines like: Era Aviation, PenAir, and Frontier Flying Service. The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered Bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan, the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities. But perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the Bush seaplane. The world&apos;s busiest seaplane base is Lake Hood, located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and lots of items from stores and warehouse clubs.

Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times, dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the most well known is the Iditarod, a 1,150-mile trail from Anchorage to Nome. The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash prizes and prestige.

*67.6% White (Non-Hispanic)
*15.6% Native American or Alaska Native
*4.1% Hispanic
*4% Asian
*3.5% Black
*5.4% Mixed race

The largest ancestry groups in the state are: German (16.6%), Alaska Native/American Indian (15.6%), Irish (10.8%), English (9.6%), American (5.7%), and Norwegian (4.2%).  Alaska has the largest percentage of American Indians (16%) of any state.

The vast, sparsely populated bush regions of northern and western Alaska are primarily inhabited by Alaska Natives, and they also have a large presence in the southeast. Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other parts of south-central and southeast Alaska have many whites of northern and western European ancestry. The Wrangell-Petersburg area has many residents of Scandinavian ancestry and the Aleutians have many Filipinos. Most of the state&apos;s black population lives in Anchorage.

As of 2000, 85.7% of Alaska residents age 5 and older speak English at home and 5.2% speak Native American languages. Spanish speakers make up 2.9% of the population, followed by Tagalog speakers at 1.5% and Korean at 0.8%.

<h2>Religion</h2>
*Christian   81%
**Protestant   68%
***Baptist   11%
***Lutheran   8%
***Methodist   6%
***Pentecostal   2%
***Episcopal   1% 
***Quaker   1%
**Orthodox   8%
**Catholic   7%
**Mormon   1%
*Other religions   1%
*Not religious/agnostic   17%

Notable is Alaska&apos;s relatively large Eastern Orthodox Christian population, a result of early Russian colonization and missionary work among indigenous Alaskans.

<h1>Social issues</h1>
Alaska has long had a problem with alcohol use and abuse. Many rural communities in Alaska have outlawed its import. &quot;Dry&quot;, &quot;wet&quot;, and &quot;damp&quot; are terms describing a community&apos;s laws on liquor consumption. This problem directly relates to Alaska&apos;s high rate of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) as well as contributing to the high rate of suicides. This is a controversial topic for many residents.

Alaska has long had a problem with &quot;brain drain&quot; as many of its young people, including most of the highest academic achievers, leave the state upon graduating high school.  The state has been successfully combating this by offering 4 year scholarships to the top 10 percent of Alaska high school graduates.

<h1>Notable Alaskans</h1>
The National Statuary Hall of the United States of America is part of the Capitol in Washington, D.C.  Each state has selected one or two distinguished citizens and provided statues. Alaska&apos;s are of its first two senators: 
* Edward Lewis &quot;Bob&quot; Bartlett (1904 1968) was the territorial delegate to the US Congress from 1944 to 1958, and was elected as the first senior U.S. Senator in 1958 and re-elected in 1964.  There are streets, buildings, and even the first state ferry, named for him.
* Ernest Gruening (1886 1974) was appointed Governor of the Territory of Alaska in 1939, and served in that position for fourteen years. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1958 and re-elected in 1962. 
* Jay Hammond (1922 2005) was Governor during the building of the Alaska Pipeline and established the Alaska Permanent Fund, providing Alaskans with essentially free money. He is regarded as somewhat of a hero because of this.  He also governor during passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and effectively served to moderate associated issues within the state among disparate interest groups ranging from conservationists to natives to pro-development interests.
* Fran Ulmer was the first woman elected to statewide office she became Lieutenant Governor in 1994. 
* Republican Lisa Murkowski was appointed as a U.S. Senator, by her father, Governor Frank Murkowski, a long time U.S. Senator, to fill his Senate term, vacated in 2002. She won her first election to the Senate in 2004 in a close and expensive race with former Governor Tony Knowles, a Democrat, who had served 8 years as Governor and many years as the mayor of Anchorage prior.
* George Sharrock (1910 2005) moved to the territory before statehood, eventually elected as the mayor of Anchorage and served during the Good Friday Earthquake in March 1964. This was the most devastating earthquake to hit Alaska and it sunk beach property, damaged roads and destroyed buildings all over the south central area. Sharrock, sometimes called the &quot;earthquake mayor,&quot; led the city&apos;s rebuilding effort over six months.
* Lisa Lacy (1980-   ) Business journalist for Dow Jones that has broken some of the more significant life science news of the mid 2000s.

A farmer in Germany working the land in the traditional way, with a horse and plough

Agriculture is the process of producing food, feed, fiber and other desired products by the cultivation of certain plants and the raising of domesticated animals (livestock). The practice of agriculture is also known as &quot;farming,&quot; while scientists, inventors and others devoted to improving farming methods and implements are also said to be engaged in agriculture.

More people in the world are involved in agriculture as their primary economic activity than in any other, yet it only accounts for four percent of the world&apos;s GDP.

<h1>Overview</h1>
Tea plantation in Java, Indonesia

Agriculture can refer to subsistence agriculture, the production of enough food to meet just the needs of the farmer/agriculturalist and his/her family. 
It may also refer to industrial agriculture, (often refered to as factory farming) long prevalent in &quot;developed&quot; nations and increasingly so elsewhere, which consists of obtaining financial income from the cultivation of land to yield produce, the commercial raising of animals (animal husbandry), or both.

Agriculture is also short for the study of the practice of agriculture more formally known as agricultural science. Agricultural students are known (sometimes derisively) as &quot;Aggies&quot;.

Increasingly, in addition to food for humans and animal feeds, agriculture produces goods such as cut flowers, ornamental and nursery plants, timber or lumber, fertilizers, animal hides, leather, industrial chemicals (starch, sugar, ethanol, alcohols and plastics), fibers (cotton, wool, hemp, and flax), fuels (methane from biomass, biodiesel) and both legal and illegal drugs (biopharmaceuticals, tobacco, marijuana, opium, cocaine). Genetically engineered plants and animals produce specialty drugs.

In the Western world, the use of gene manipulation, better management of soil nutrients, and improved weed control have greatly increased yields per unit area. At the same time, the use of mechanization has decreased labour requirements. The developing world generally produces lower yields, having less of the latest science, capital, and technology base.

Modern agriculture depends heavily on engineering and technology and on the biological and physical sciences. Irrigation, drainage, conservation and sanitary engineering, each of which is important in successful farming, are some of the fields requiring the specialized knowledge of agricultural engineers.

Agricultural chemistry deals with other vital farming concerns, such as the application of fertilizer, insecticides (see Pest control), and fungicides, soil makeup, analysis of agricultural products, and nutritional needs of farm animals.

Plant breeding and genetics contribute immeasurably to farm productivity. Genetics has also made a science of livestock breeding. Hydroponics, a method of soilless gardening in which plants are grown in chemical nutrient solutions, may help meet the need for greater food production as the world&apos;s population increases.

The packing, processing, and marketing of agricultural products are closely related activities also influenced by science. Methods of quick-freezing and dehydration have increased the markets for farm products (see Food preservation; Meat packing industry).

Mechanization, the outstanding characteristic of late 19th and 20th century agriculture, has eased much of the backbreaking toil of the farmer. More significantly, mechanization has enormously increased farm efficiency and productivity (see Agricultural machinery). Animals, including horses, mules, oxen, camels, llamas, alpacas, and dogs; however, are still used to cultivate fields, harvest crops and transport farm products to markets in many parts of the world.

Airplanes, helicopters, trucks and tractors are used in agriculture for seeding, spraying operations for insect and disease control, Aerial topdressing, transporting perishable products, and fighting forest fires. Radio and television disseminate vital weather reports and other information such as market reports that concern farmers. Computers have become an essential tool for farm management.

According to the National Academy of Engineering in the US, agricultural mechanization is one of the 20 greatest engineering achievements of the 20th century. Early in the century, it took one American farmer to produce food for 2.5 people, where today, due to engineering technology (also, plant breeding and agrichemicals), a single farmer can feed over 130 people . This comes at a cost, however, of large amounts of energy input, from unsustainable, mostly fossil fuel, sources.

Animal husbandry means breeding and raising animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, eggs, or wool) on a continual basis.

In recent years some aspects of industrial intensive agriculture have been the subject of increasing discussion. The widening sphere of influence held by large seed and chemical companies, meat packers and food processors has been a source of concern both within the farming community and for the general public. There has been increased activity of some people against some farming practices, raising chickens for food being one example. Another issue is the type of feed-stock given to some animals that can cause Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in cattle.  There has also been concern because of the disastrous effect that intensive agricualture has on the enviornment.  In the US, for example, fertilizer has been running off into the Mississippi for years and has caused a dead spot in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Mississippi empties.  Intensive agriculture also depletes the fertility of the land over time and the end effect is that which happened in the Middle East, were some of the most fertile farm land in the world was turned into a desert by intensive agriculture.

The patent protection given to companies that develop new types of seed using genetic engineering has allowed seed to be licensed to farmers in much the same way that computer software is licensed to users. This has changed the balance of power in favor of the seed companies, allowing them to dictate terms and conditions previously unheard of. Some argue these companies are guilty of biopiracy.

Soil conservation and nutrient management have been important concerns since the 1950s, with the best farmers taking a stewardship role with the land they operate. However, increasing contamination of waterways and wetlands by nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are of concern in many countries.

Increasing consumer awareness of agricultural issues has led to the rise of  community-supported agriculture, local food movement, slow food, and commercial organic farming, though these yet remain fledgling industries.

<h1>History</h1>
Ancient Egyptian farmer

Archaeobotanists have traced the selection and cultivation of specific food plant characteristics, such as a semi-tough rachis and larger seeds, to just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Limited anthropological and archaeological evidence both indicate a grain-grinding culture farming along the Nile in the 10th millennium BC using the world&apos;s earliest known type of sickle blades. There is even earlier evidence for conscious cultivation and seasonal harvest: grains of rye with domestic traits have been recovered from Epi-Palaeolithic (10,000+ BC) contexts at Abu Hureyra in Syria, but this appears to be a localised phenomenon resulting from cultivation of stands of wild rye, rather than a definitive step towards domestication. It is not until ca. 8,500 BC, in middle-Eastern cultures referred to as Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), where there is the first definite evidence for the emergence of a widespread subsistence economy that was dependent on domesticated plants and animals. In these contexts lie the origins of the eight so-called founder crops of agriculture: firstly emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, pea, lentil, bitter vetch, chick pea and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on PPNB sites in this region, although the consensus is that wheat was the first to be sown and harvested on a significant scale. There are many sites that date to between ca. 8,500 BC and 7,500 BC where the systematic farming of these crops contributed the major part of the inhabitants&apos; diet. From the Fertile Crescent agriculture spread eastwards to Central Asia and westwards into Cyprus, Anatolia and, by 7,000 BC, Greece. Farming, principally of emmer and einkorn, reached northwestern Europe via southeastern and central Europe by ca. 4,800 BC (see, among others, Price, D. [ed.] 2000. Europe&apos;s First Farmers. Cambridge University Press; Harris, D. [ed.] 1996 The Origins and Spread of Agriculture in Eurasia. UCL Press).

The reasons for the earliest introduction of farming may have included climate change, but possibly there were also social reasons (e.g. accumulation of food surplus for competitive gift-giving). Most certainly there was a gradual transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural economies after a lengthy period when some crops were deliberately planted and other foods were gathered from the wild. Although localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the Levant, the fact that farming was &apos;invented&apos; at least three times, possibly more, suggests that social reasons may have been instrumental. In addition to emergence of farming in the Fertile Crescent, agriculture appeared by at least 6,800 BC in East Asia (rice) and, later, in Central and South America (maize, squash). Small scale agriculture also likely arose independently in early Neolithic contexts in India (rice) and Southeast Asia (taro).

Full dependency on domestic crops and animals (i.e. when wild resources contributed a nutritionally insignificant component to the diet) was not until the Bronze Age. If the operative definition of agriculture includes large scale intensive cultivation of land, mono-cropping, organised irrigation, and use of a specialized labour force, the title &quot;inventors of agriculture&quot; would fall to the Sumerians, starting ca. 5,500 BC. Intensive farming allows a much greater density of population than can be supported by hunting and gathering and allows for the accumulation of excess product to keep for winter use or to sell for profit. The ability of farmers to feed large numbers of people whose activities have nothing to do with material production was the crucial factor in the rise of standing armies. The agriculturalism of the Sumerians allowed them to embark on an unprecedented territorial expansion, making them the first empire builders. Not long after, the Egyptians, powered by effective farming of the Nile valley, achieved a population density from which enough warriors could be drawn for a territorial expansion more than tripling the Sumerian empire in area.

The invention of a three field system of crop rotation during in the Middle Ages vastly improved agricultural efficiency.

After 1492 the world&apos;s agricultural patterns were shuffled in the widespread exchange of plants and animals known as the Columbian Exchange.  Crops and animals that were previously only known in the Old World were now transplanted to the New and vice versa. Perhaps most notably, the tomato became a favorite in European cuisine, while certain wheat strains quickly took to western hemisphere soils and became a dietary staple even for native North, Central and South Americans.

By the early 1800s agricultural practices, particularly careful selection of hardy strains and cultivars, had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages and before, especially in the largely virgin lands of North and South America. With the rapid rise of mechanization in the 20th century, especially in the form of the tractor, the demanding tasks of sowing, harvesting and threshing could be performed with a speed and on a scale barely imaginable before. These advances have led to efficiencies enabling certain modern farms in the United States, Argentina, Israel, Germany and a few other nations to output volumes of high quality produce per land unit at what may be the practical limit.

<h2>Crop improvement</h2>

*See main article on Plant breeding

Domestication of plants is done in order to increase yield, improve disease resistance and drought tolerance, ease harvest and to improve the taste and nutritional value and many other characteristics. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant breeders use greenhouses and other techniques to get as many as three generations of plants per year so that they can make improvements all the more quickly.

Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and &apos;30s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive radiation mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn and barley.

For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001, primarily due to improvements in genetics. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Higher yields are due to improvements in genetics, as well as use of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).

[Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat = 60 pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215 kg. 1 bushel of corn = 56 pounds ≈ 25.401 kg]

Very recently, genetic engineering has begun to be employed in some parts of the world to speed up the selection and breeding process. The most widely used modification is a herbicide resistance gene that allows plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate, which is used to control weeds in the crop. A less frequently used but more controversial modification causes the plant to produce a toxin to reduce damage from insects (c.f. Starlink).

There are specialty producers who raise less common types of livestock or plants.

Aquaculture, the farming of fish, shrimp, and algae, is closely associated with agriculture.

Apiculture, the culture of bees, traditionally for honey increasingly for crop pollination.

<h1>Environmental problems</h1>
Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful by-products. Some of the negatives effects are:

* Nitrogen and phosphorus surplus in rivers and lakes.
* Detrimental effects of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other biocides.
* Conversion of natural ecosystems of all types into arable land.
* Consolidation of diverse biomass into a few species.
* Erosion
* Particulate matter, including ammonia and ammonium off-gasing from animal waste contributing to air pollution
* Weeds - feral plants and animals
* Odor from agricultural waste
* Soil salination in dry areas.

<h1>Policy</h1>
Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:
*Food safety: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination.
*Food security: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population&apos;s needs.
*Food quality: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality.

* Conservation
* Environmental impact
* Economic stability

Aldous Huxley

Aldous Leonard Huxley (July 26, 1894   November 22, 1963) was a British writer who emigrated to the United States. He was a member of the famous Huxley family who produced a number of brilliant scientific minds. Best known for his novels and wide-ranging output of essays, he also published short stories, poetry, travel writing, and film stories and scripts. Through his novels and essays Huxley functioned as an examiner and sometimes critic of social mores, societal norms and ideals, and possible misapplications of science in human life. While his earlier concerns might be called &quot;humanist,&quot; ultimately, he became quite interested in &quot;spiritual&quot; subjects like parapsychology and mystically based philosophy, which he also wrote about. By the end of his life, Huxley was considered, in certain learned circles, a &apos;leader of modern thought&apos;.

<h1>Biography</h1>

<h2>Early years</h2>
Family tree
Huxley was born in Godalming, Surrey, England. He was the son of the writer Leonard Huxley by his first wife, Julia Arnold; and grandson of the famous proponent of Charles Darwin, Thomas Huxley. His brother Julian Huxley was a biologist also noted for his evolutionary theories. Huxley understandably excelled in the areas he took up professionally, for on his father&apos;s side were a number of noted men of science, while on his mother&apos;s were people of literary accomplishment.

Huxley was a lanky, delicately framed child who was gifted intellectually. His father was a professional herbalist as well as an author, so Aldous began his learning in his father&apos;s well-equipped botanical laboratory, then continued in a school named Hillside, which his mother supervised for several years until she became terminally ill. From the age of nine, Aldous was then educated in the British boarding school system. He took readily to the handling of ideas.

His mother Julia died in 1908, when Aldous was only fourteen, and his sister Roberta died of an unrelated incident in the same month. Three years later Aldous suffered an illness (keratitis punctata) which seriously damaged his eyesight. His older brother Trev committed suicide in 1914. Aldous&apos;s near-blindness disqualified him from service in World War I. Once his eyesight recovered, he was able to read English literature at Balliol College, Oxford.

Maturing as a lean young man well over six feet in height, the cerebrotonic Huxley&apos;s initial interest in literature was primarily intellectual. While he was noted for his personal kindliness, only considerably later (some say under the influence of such friends as D.H. Lawrence) did he heartily embrace feelings as matters of importance in his evolving personal philosophy and literary expression.

Following his education at Balliol, Huxley was financially indebted to his father and had to earn a living. For a short while in 1918, he was employed acquiring provisions at the Air Ministry. But never desiring a career in administration (or in business), Huxley&apos;s lack of inherited means propelled him into applied literary work.

Huxley had completed his first (unpublished) novel at the age of seventeen and began writing seriously in his early twenties. He wrote great novels on dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously Brave New World, and on pacifist themes (e.g. Eyeless in Gaza). Huxley was strongly influenced by F. Matthias Alexander and included him as a character in Eyeless in Gaza.

<h2>Middle years</h2>
Already a noted satirist and social thinker, during World War I, Huxley spent much of his time at Garsington Manor, home of Lady Ottoline Morrell. Later, in Crome Yellow (1921) he caricatured the Garsington lifestyle, but remained friendly with the Morrells. He married Maria Nys, whom he had met at Garsington.

Huxley moved to  Llano, California in 1937, but like his friend the philosopher Gerald Heard who accompanied him, Huxley was denied citizenship since he refused to ascribe his pacifism to religious beliefs. In his 1937 book Ends and Means, most people in modern civilization agree that they want a world of &apos;liberty, peace, justice, and brotherly love&apos;, though they haven&apos;t been able to agree on how to achieve it. His book goes on to explore why the confusion or disagreement is there and what might be done about it.

In 1938 Huxley befriended J. Krishnamurti, whose teachings he greatly admired. He became a Vedantist in the circle of Swami  Prabhavananda, and he also introduced Christopher Isherwood to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, The Perennial Philosophy, which discussed teachings of the world&apos;s great mystics.

For most of his life since the illness in his teens which left Huxley nearly blind, his eyesight was poor (despite the partial recovery which had enabled him to study at Oxford). Around 1939 he heard of the Bates Method for Natural Vision Improvement, and of a teacher (Margaret Corbett) who was able to teach him in the method. He claimed his sight improved dramatically as a result of using the method, then later wrote a book about it (The Art of Seeing) which was published in 1942 (US), 1943 (UK). He reported that for the first time in over 25 years, he was able to read without spectacles and without strain. He was a screenwriter for the 1940 production of Pride and Prejudice.

<h2>Later years</h2>
He started meditating and became a vegetarian. Thereafter, his works were strongly influenced by mysticism and his experiences with the hallucinogenic drug mescaline, to which he was introduced by the psychiatrist Humphry Osmond in 1953. Huxley&apos;s psychedelic drug experiences are described in the essays The Doors of Perception (the title deriving from some lines in the book The Marriage of Heaven and Hell by William Blake) and Heaven and Hell. The title of the former became the inspiration for the naming of the rock band, The Doors. Some of his writings on psychedelics became frequent reading among early hippies.

Huxley&apos;s main interest was not in just anything vague, mysterious, or subjective, but in what is sometimes termed &quot;higher mysticism&quot;; he liked the term &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; that he used as the title of his noted book on the topic. During the 1950s, Huxley&apos;s interest in the related field of psychical research grew keener.

Huxley&apos;s wife, Maria, died of breast cancer in 1955, and in 1956 he remarried, to Laura Archera, who was herself an author and who wrote a biography of Aldous. In 1960, Huxley was diagnosed with throat cancer. In the years that followed, with his health deteriorating, he wrote the utopian novel Island, and gave lectures on &quot;Human Potentialities&quot; at the Esalen institute. In 1959, Huxley, who remained a British Citizen turned down an offer of a Knight Bachelor by the Macmillan government.

His ideas were foundational to the forming of the Human Potential Movement. He was also invited to speak at several prestigious American universities. At a speech given in 1961 at the California Medical School in San Francisco, Huxley warned: &quot;There will be in the next generation or so a pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears, so to speak, producing a kind of painless concentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have their liberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it.&quot;

Huxley&apos;s views on the proper roles of science and technology (as he portrayed these, say, in Island) are akin to some other noted English and American thinkers of the twentieth century, such as Lewis Mumford and Huxley&apos;s friend Gerald Heard (and, in some ways, Buckminster Fuller and E.F. Schumacher). Clearly, these men found descendants in some significant movers of a younger generation, e.g., Stewart Brand.

Amongst humanists, Huxley was considered an intellectual&apos;s intellectual. Although his financial circumstances had forced him to churn out articles and books, his thinking and best writing earned him an exalted esteem. His books were frequently on the required reading lists of English and modern philosophy courses in American colleges and universities. He was one of the twentieth-century thinkers honoured in the Scribners Publishing&apos;s &quot;Leaders of Modern Thought&quot; series (a volume of biography and literary criticism by Philip Thody, Aldous Huxley).

<h2>Death and afterwards</h2>
On his deathbed, unable to speak, he made a written request to his wife for &quot;LSD, 100 µg, i.m.&quot; She obliged, and he died peacefully the following morning, November 22, 1963. Media coverage of his death was overshadowed by news of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, which occurred on the same day, as did the death of British author C. S. Lewis.

In all of Huxley&apos;s mature writings, one finds an awareness that seems to bridge the gap between &quot;The Two Cultures&quot;   the sciences and the humanities. This gulf posed a potentially enormous problem, one that was recognized by other thinkers during Huxley&apos;s lifetime, such as C.P. Snow. The interest among professors of humanities and liberal arts in Huxley&apos;s work, both during the writer&apos;s lifetime and afterwards, rests on this consciousness on the part of the author, and of course on the artful and often humorous way in which he expressed himself.

Huxley&apos;s satirical, dystopian, and utopian novels seldom fail to stimulate thought. The same may be said for his essays and essay collections. Perhaps his main message is the tragedy that frequently follows from egocentrism, self-centredness, and selfishness.

<h1>Films</h1>

Huxley wrote many screenplays, and many of his novels were later adapted for film or television.

Notable works include the original screenplay for Disney&apos;s animated Alice in Wonderland, two productions of Brave New World, one of Point Counter Point, one of Eyeless in Gaza, and one of Ape and Essence. He was one of the screenwriters for Pride and Prejudice (1940 movie) and co-wrote the screenplay for the Jane Eyre (1944 movie) with John Houseman.  Director Ken Russell&apos;s 1971 film The Devils, starring Vanessa Redgrave, is adapted from Huxley&apos;s The Devils of Loudun, and a 1990 made-for-television film adaptation of Brave New World was directed by Burt Brinckeroffer

Anarchy (New Latin anarchia, from  Greek     , &quot;no&quot; +     , &quot;rule&quot;) is a term that has several usages. Specific meanings include

# Absence of any form of state.
# Societal harmony through voluntary cooperation. (In contrast to the following &quot;Political disorder and confusion&quot; &apos;meaning&apos;) (Also known as anarchism)
# Political disorder and confusion.
# Absence of a ruler, ruling class, ruling political party or parties, or power elite. 
<h1>Etymology</h1>
The word anarchy comes from the Greek word         (anarchia), which means &quot;without a ruler&quot; (an- meaning &quot;without&quot;, arch- root denoting &quot;rule&quot;, and -ia corresponding to the English suffix &quot;-y&quot; in &quot;monarchy&quot;). It originated from the word anarchos which means either &quot;without head or chief&quot; or &quot;without beginning&quot; (Liddell &amp; Scott&apos;s Greek-English Lexicon).  Anarchos was  a description often applied to God - to be &quot;uncaused&quot; was considered divine.  A King or founder might be called the archegos (       , from arch  + agein, &quot;to lead&quot;) or just the arch n (     , participle of archein, &quot;to rule&quot;) or the archos (     , from archein + -os, masculine ending) which mean &quot;ruler.&quot;  Athenian democracy was not considered anarchia because, like modern England, Athens had Kings.  In fact there were nine archontes led by an arch n (Liddell &amp; Scott).  These &quot;rulers&quot; served mainly religious and magisterial purposes, but their existence precluded the Athenians from calling their government anarchia.  Instead of calling themselves anarchos, the Athenians described their situation as eleutheros (&quot;free&quot;).

<h1>Anarchy in Ancient Greece</h1>
In Athens, the year 404 BC was commonly referred to as &quot;the year of anarchy&quot;. According to the historian Xenophon, this happened even though Athens was at the times under the rule of the oligarchy of &quot;The Thirty,&quot; installed by the Spartans following their victory in the second Peloponnesian war, and despite the presence of an Archon, nominated by the oligarchs, in the person of Pythodorus. However, Athenians refused to apply here their custom of calling the year by that archon&apos;s name, since he was elected during the oligarchy, and &quot;preferred to speak of it as the &apos;year of anarchy&apos;&quot;.

The Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle used the term anarchy negatively, in association with democracy which they mistrusted as inherently vulnerable and prone to deteriorate into tyranny. Plato believed that the corruption created by democracy loosens the &quot;natural&quot; hierarchy between social classes, genders and age groups, to the extent that &quot;anarchy finds a way into the private houses, and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them&quot; (&apos;Republic&apos;, book 8). Aristotle spoke of it in book 6 of the &apos;Politics&apos; when discussing revolutions, saying that the upper classes may be motivated to stage a coup by their contempt for the prevailing &quot;disorder and anarchy (ataxias kai anarkhias)&quot; in the affairs of the state. He also claimed it would give, &quot;license among slaves (anarkhia te doulôn)&quot; as well as among women and children. &quot;A constitution of this sort&quot;, he concludes, &quot;will have a large number of supporters, as disorderly living (zên ataktôs) is pleasanter to the masses than sober living&quot;.

A seaweed (Laurencia) up close: the &quot;branches&quot; are multicellular and only about 1 mm thick. Much smaller algae are seen attached to the structure extending upwards near the lower right corner
:This article is about an organism. See algae programming language for a programming language in computing.
The algae (singular alga) comprise several different groups of living organisms usually found in wet places or water bodies and that capture light energy through photosynthesis, converting inorganic substances into simple sugars with the captured energy.  Algae were traditionally regarded as simple plants, and some are closely related to the higher plants.  Others appear to represent different protist groups, alongside other organisms that are traditionally considered more animal-like (protozoa).  Thus algae do not represent a single evolutionary group, but a level of organization that may have developed several times in the early evolutionary history of life on earth.

Algae range from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular organisms, some with fairly complex differentiated form and called seaweeds. All lack leaves, roots, flowers, and other organ structures that characterize higher plants.  They are distinguished from other protozoa in that they are photoautotrophic, although this is not a hard and fast distinction as some groups may contain members that are mixotrophic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis as well as through the uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy, myzotrophy, or phagotrophy. Some unicellular algae rely entirely on external energy sources and have reduced or lost their photosynthetic apparatus.

All algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from the cyanobacteria, and so produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, unlike other, non-cyanobacterial photosynthetic bacteria.

Algae are common in terrestrial as well as aquatic environments, but usually inconspicuous on the land and more common in moist, tropical climates (see, however Lichens).  The various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology.  Microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column, called phytoplankton, provide the food base for most marine food chains.  In very high densities (so-called algal blooms) they may discolor the water and outcompete or poison other life forms.  The seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters; some are used as human food or are harvested for useful substances such as agar or fertilizer.  The study of algae is called phycology or algology.

<h1> Relationships among algal groups </h1>
<h2> Prokaryotic algae </h2>
Traditionally the cyanobacteria have been included among the algae, referred to as the cyanophytes or Blue-green Algae, though some recent treatises on algae specifically exclude them.  Cyanobacteria is one of the first groups of living things to appear in the fossil record, dating back some 3800 million years ago (Precambrian) when they may have played a major role in creating Earth&apos;s oxygen atmosphere.  They have a prokaryotic cell structure typical of bacteria and conduct photosynthesis directly within the cytoplasm, rather than in specialized organelles.

<h2> Eukaryotic algae </h2>
All other algae are eukaryotes and conduct photosynthesis within membrane-bound structures (organelles) called chloroplasts.  Chloroplasts contain DNA and are similar in structure to cyanobacteria, presumably representing reduced cyanobacterial endosymbionts.  The exact nature of the chloroplasts is different among the different lines of algae, possibly reflecting different endosymbiotic events.  There are three groups that have primary chloroplasts:

* Green algae, together with higher plants
* Red algae
* Glaucophytes

In these groups the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes, both now thought to come from the chloroplast.  The chloroplasts of red algae have a more or less typical cyanobacterial pigmentation, while the green algae and higher plants have chloroplasts with chlorophyll a and b, the latter found in some cyanobacteria but not most.  There is reasonably solid evidence that these three groups originated from a common pigmented ancestor; i.e., chloroplasts developed in a single endosymbiotic event.

Two other groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophyll b:

* euglenids and 
* chlorarachniophytes.

These are surrounded by three and four membranes, respectively, and were probably retained from an ingested green alga.  Those of the chlorarchniophytes contain a small nucleomorph, which is the remnant of the alga&apos;s nucleus.  It has been suggested that the euglenid chloroplasts only have three membranes because they were acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis.

The remaining algae all have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c.  The latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts, but genetic similarities with the red algae suggest a relationship there.  These groups include:

* Heterokonts (e.g., golden algae, diatoms, brown algae)
* Haptophytes (e.g., coccolithophores)
* Cryptomonads
* Dinoflagellates

In the first three of these groups (Chromista), the chloroplast has four membranes, retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads, and it now appears that they share a common pigmented ancestor.  The typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes, but there is considerable diversity in chloroplasts among the group, some members presumably having acquired theirs from other sources.  The Apicomplexa, a group of closely related parasites, also have plastids though not actual chloroplasts, which appear to have a common origin with those of the dinoflagellates.

Note many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic.  Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, while others have lost them entirely.

<h1> Forms of algae </h1>
Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids, but colonial and non-motile forms have developed independently among several of the groups.  Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in the life cycle of a species, are:

* Colonial - small, regular groups of motile cells
* Capsoid - individual non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* Coccoid - individual non-motile cells with cell walls
* Palmelloid - non-motile cells embedded in mucilage
* Filamentous - a string of non-motile cells connected together, sometimes branching
* Parenchymatous - cells forming a thallus with partial differentiation of tissues

In three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached, leading to organisms with full tissue differentiation.  These are the brown algae some of which may reach 70 m in length (kelps) the red algae, and the green algae. The most complex forms are found among the green algae (see Charales), in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants.  The point where these non-algal plants begin and algae stop is usually taken to be the presence of reproductive organs with protective cell layers, a characteristic not found in the other algal groups.

<h1> Algae and symbioses</h1>
Algae frequently form part of a symbiosis with other organisms. In these symbioses, the algae photosynthesise and supply photosynthates to their host. The host organism is then capable of deriving some or all of its energy requirements from the alga. Examples include:
* lichens - a fungus is the host, usually with a green alga or a cyanobacterium as the symbiont. Both fungi and algae found in lichens are capable of living independantly.
* corals - several algae form symbioses (zooxanthellae) with corals. Notable amongst these is the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, found in many hard corals. The loss of Symbiodinium, or other zooxanthellae, from the host leads to coral bleaching.

In statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated procedures which compare means by splitting the overall observed variance into different parts.  The initial techniques of the analysis of variance were pioneered by the statistician and geneticist Ronald Fisher in the 1920s and 1930s, and is sometimes known as Fisher&apos;s ANOVA or Fisher&apos;s analysis of variance.

<h1>Overview</h1>

There are three conceptual classes of such models:
*Fixed-effects model assumes that the data come from normal populations which differ in their means.
*Random-effects models assume that the data describe a hierarchy of different populations whose differences are constrained by the hierarchy.
*Mixed models describe situations where both fixed and random effects are present.

The fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares into components related to the effects in the model used. For example, we show the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels. (If the treatment levels are quantitative and the effects are linear, a linear regression analysis may be appropriate.)

:  SS_{\hbox{Total}} = SS_{\hbox{Error}} + SS_{\hbox{Treatments}}.

The number of degrees of freedom (abbreviated df) can be partitioned in a similar way and specifies the chi-square distribution which describes the associated sums of squares.

:  df_{\hbox{Total}} = df_{\hbox{Error}} + df_{\hbox{Treatments}}.

<h1> Fixed-effects model </h1>

The fixed-effects model of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter has subjected his experimental material to several treatments, each of which affects only the mean of the underlying normal distribution of the &quot;response variable&quot;.

<h1> Random-effects model </h1>

Random effects models are used to describe situations in which incomparable differences in experimental material occur. The simplest example is that of estimating the unknown mean of a population whose individuals differ from each other. In this case, the variation between individuals is confounded with that of the observing instrument.
...

<h1> Degrees of freedom </h1>

Degrees of freedom indicates the effective number of observations which contribute to the sum of squares in an ANOVA, the total number of observations minus the number of linear constraints in the data.

<h1> Tests of significance </h1>

Analyses of variance lead to tests of statistical significance using Fisher&apos;s F-distribution.

:For saturated hydrocarbons containing one or more rings, see Cycloalkane.

An alkane in organic chemistry is a saturated hydrocarbon without cycles, that is, an acyclic hydrocarbon in which the molecule has the maximum possible number of hydrogen atoms and so has no double bonds.  
Alkanes are also often known as paraffins, or collectively as the paraffin series;  these terms, however, are also used to apply only to alkanes whose carbon atoms form a single, unbranched chain; when this is done, branched-chain alkanes are called isoparaffins. 
Alkanes are aliphatic compounds.

The general formula for alkanes is C n H 2n+2 ; the simplest possible alkane is therefore methane, CH 4 . The next simplest is ethane, C 2 H 6 ; the series continues indefinitely.  Each carbon atom in an alkane has sp 3  hybridization.

<h1>Isomerism</h1>

The atoms in alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in multiple ways, forming different isomers. &quot;Normal&quot; alkanes have a linear, unbranched configuration. The number of isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms; for  alkanes with 1 to 12 carbon atoms, the number of isomers equals 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18, 35, 75, 159, and 355, respectively (sequence A000602 in OEIS).

<h1>Nomenclature of alkanes</h1>
The names of all alkanes end with -ane.

<h2>Alkanes with unbranched carbon chains</h2>
The first four members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:
:methane, CH 4 
:ethane, C 2 H 6 
:propane, C 3 H 8 
:butane, C 4 H 10 
Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier with elision of a terminal -a- from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C 5 H 12 ; hexane, C 6 H 14 ; heptane, C 7 H 16 ; octane, C 8 H 18 ; etc. For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.

Straight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n- (for normal) to distinguish them from branched-chain alkanes having the same number of carbon atoms. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers: e.g. n-hexane is a neurotoxin while its branched-chain isomers are not.

<h2>Alkanes with branched carbon chains</h2>
Branched alkanes are named as follows:

* Identify the longest straight chain of carbon atoms.

* Number the atoms in this chain, starting from 1 at one end and counting upwards to the other end.

* Examine the groups attached to the chain in order and form their names.

* Form the name by looking at the different attached groups, and writing, for each group, the following:

** The number, or numbers, of the carbon atom, or atoms, where it is attached.

** The prefixes di-, tri-, tetra-, etc. if the group is attached in 2, 3, 4, etc. places, or nothing if it is attached in only one place.

** The name of the attached group.

* The formation of the name is finished by writing down the name of the longest straight chain.

To carry out this algorithm, we must know how to name the substituent groups.  This is done by the same method, except that instead of the longest chain of carbon atoms, the longest chain starting from the attachment point is used; also, the numbering is done so that the carbon atom next to the attachment point has the number 1.

For example, the compound

is the only 4-carbon alkane possible, apart from butane.  Its formal name is 2-methylpropane.

Pentane, however, has two branched isomers, in addition to its linear, normal form:

2,2-dimethylpropane

and

2-methylbutane.

<h2>Trivial names</h2>
The following nonsystematic names are retained in the IUPAC system:
:isobutane for 2-methylpropane
:isopentane for 2-methylbutane
:neopentane for 2,2-dimethylpropane
The name isooctane is very widely used in the petrochemical industry to refer to 2,2,4-trimethylpentane.

<h1>Occurrence</h1>

Methane and ethane make up a large proportion of Jupiter&apos;s atmosphere
Alkanes occur both on Earth and in the solar system, however only the first hundred or so, and even then mostly only in traces. The light hydrocarbons, especially methane and ethane are of great importance for other heavenly bodies: they are found, for example, both in the tail of the comet Hyakutake and in some meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites. They also form an important portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. On Titan, the satellite of Saturn, it is believed that there were once large oceans of these and longer chain alkanes: smaller seas of liquid ethane are thought still to exist there.

Traces of methane (about 0.0001% or 1 ppm) occur in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere, produced primarily by forms of Archaea. The content in the oceans is negligible due to the low solubility in water: however, at high pressures and low temperatures, methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid methane hydrate. Although they cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the calorific value of the known methane hydrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane hydrate is considered therefore a candidate for future fuels.

Extraction of alkanes in Ontario
Today, the most important commercial sources for alkanes are clearly natural gas and oil, which are the only organic compounds to occur as minerals in nature. Natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane, with some propane and butane: oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons. Both developed when dead sea animals were covered with sediments to the exclusion of oxygen and converted over many millions years at high temperatures and high pressure to the respective natural substances. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:
:C 6 H 12 O 6    3CH 4  + 3CO 2 
They collected themselves in porous rocks, which were sealed by impermeable layers above. In contrast to methane, which is constantly reformed in large quantities, higher alkanes rarely develop to a considerable extent in nature. The present deposits will not be reformed once they are exhausted.

Solid alkanes occur as evaporation residues from oil, known as tar. One of the largest natural deposits of solid alkanes is in the bitumen lake known as La Brea on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.

<h1>Purification and use</h1>

An oil refinery at Martinez, California
Alkanes are both important raw materials of the chemical industry and the most important fuels of the world economy.

The starting materials for the processing are always natural gas and crude oil. The latter is separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many different products, for example gasoline. The different &quot;fractions&quot; of crude oil have different boiling points and can be isolated and separated quite easily: within the individual fractions the boiling points lie closely together.

The domain of usage of a certain alkane can be determined quite well according to the number of  carbon atoms, although the following demarcation is idealized and not perfect. The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. Methane and ethane are the main componants of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is however easier to transport them as liquids: this requires both compression and cooling of the gas.

Propane and butane can be liquefied at fairly low pressures, and are well known as liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Propane, for example, is used in the propane gas burner, butane in disposable cigarette lighters (where the pressure is a mere 2 bar). The two alkanes are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.

From pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in internal combustion engines, as the vaporise easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the unifomity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred, as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes knocking than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane number of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100 and heptane has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.

Alkanes from nonane to, for instance, hexadecane (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher viscosity, less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel. Diesel fuels are charaterised by their cetane nember, cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes to thick to flow correctly

Alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil. In latter function they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax, for example in candles. This should not be confused however with true wax, which consists primarily of esters.

Alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen, used for example in road surfacing. However the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking.

<h1>Preparation</h1>

<h1>Molecular geometry</h1>

sp 3 -hybridisation in methane.
The molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the electron configuration of carbon, which has four valence electrons. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always sp 3 -hybridised, that is to say that the valence electrons can be considered to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s-orbital and the three 2p-orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron, the angle of 109.47° between them.

<h2>Bond lengths and bond angles</h2>

The tetrahedral structure of methane.
An alkane molecule has only C H and C C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp 3 -orbital of carbon with the 1s-orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp 3 -orbitals on different carbon atoms. The bond lengths amount to 1.09×10  10  m for a C H bond and 1.54×10  10  m for a C C bond.

The spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp 3 -orbitals they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae which represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.

<h2>Conformation</h2>

The structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon carbon bond: the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation.

<h3>Ethane</h3>

Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.
Ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C C bond, then the so-called Newman projection results: the circle represents the two carbon atoms, one behind the other, and the bonds to hydrogen are represented by the straight lines. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important:

* In the eclipsed conformation, corresponding to a torsion angle of 0°, 120° or 240°, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are directly in front of those attached to the rear carbon.
* In the staggered conformation, corresponding to a torsion angle of 60°, 180° or 300°, the hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon are exactly in between those attached to the rear carbon.

The two conformations, also known as rotomers, differ in energy: the staggered conformation is 12.6 kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation. The explanation for this difference in energy has been the subject of debate, with two main theories predominating:
*in the eclipsed conformation, the electrostatic repulsion between the electrons in the carbon hydrogen bonds is maximised.
*in the staggered conformation, the hyperconjugation (a form of delocalisation) of the valence electrons is maximised.
These two explanations are not contradictory or exclusive; the latter is thought to be the more important for ethane itself.

This difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the torsion energy, is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C C bond, albeit with short &quot;pauses&quot; at each staggered conformation. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH 3 -group by 120° relative to the other, is of the order of 10  11  seconds.

<h3>Higher alkanes</h3>

The four conformations of butane. From left to right: fully eclipsed, inclined, partially eclipsed, antiperiplanar.
The situation with respect to the two C C bonds in propane is qualitatively similar to that of ethane: it is more complex, however, for butane and higher alkanes.

If one takes the central C C bond of butane as the reference axis, each of the two central carbon atoms is bound to two hydrogen atoms and a methyl group. Four different conformations can be defined by the torsion angle between the two methyl groups and, as in the case of ethane, each has its characteristic energy.

*The fully eclipsed or synperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of 0°. It is the configuration with the highest energy.

*The inclined conformation has a torsion angle of 60° (or 300°). It is a local energy minimum.

*The partially eclipsed conformation has a torsion angle of 120° (or 240°). It is a local energy maximum.

*The antiperiplanar conformation has a torsion angle of 180°. The two methyl groups are as far from each other as is possible, and this configuration has the lowest energy.

The difference in energy between the fully eclipsed conformation and the antiperiplanar conformation is about 19 kJ/mol, and is therefore still relatively small at ambient temperature.

The case of higher alaknes is similar: the antiperiplanar conformation is always the most favoured around each carbon carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealised forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.

The conformations of other organic molecules are based on those of alkanes, and are discussed in the relevant articles.

<h2>Physical properties</h2>

The molecular structure, particularly the surface area of the molecule, determines the boiling point of the alkane: the smaller the surface, the lower the boiling point, as the van der Waals forces between the molecules are weaker. A reduction of the surface area can be achieved by chain-branching or by a circular structure. This means in practice that alkanes with higher number of carbon atoms usually have higher boiling points than those with lower numbers of carbon atoms, and that branched-chain alkanes and cycloalkanes have lower boiling points than their straight-chain homologues. Under standard conditions, from CH 4  to C 4 H 10  alkanes are gaseous; from C 5 H 12  to C 17 H 36  they are liquids; and after C 18 H 38  they are solids. The boiling point increases between 20 and 30  C per CH 2 -group.

The melting points of the alkanes also rise with the increase in the number of carbon atoms (with only one exception, propane). However the melting points rise more slowly than the boiling points, in particular for the higher alkanes. In addition, the melting points of alkanes with an odd number of carbon atoms increase faster than the melting points of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms (see figure): the cause of this phenomenon is the higher packing density of the alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms. The melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, depending on the efficiency of molecular packing: this is particularly true for isoalkanes (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of their normal analogues.

Alkanes do not conduct electricity, nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field. For this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistance of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in entropy). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimised by minimising the contact between alkane and water: alkanes are said to be hydrophobic in that they repel water.

Their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property which is called lipophilicity. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.

The density of the alkanes usually increases with increasing number of carbon atoms, but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane-water mixture.

<h2>Chemical properties</h2>

Alkanes generally show a relatively low reactivity, because their C H and C C bonds are relatively stable and cannot be easily broken. Unlike all other organic compounds, they possess no functional groups.

They react only very poorly with ionic or other polar substances. The pK a  values of all alkanes are above 60, and so they are practically inert to acids and bases. This inertness is the source of the term paraffins (Latin para + affinis, with the meaning here of &quot;lacking affinity&quot;). In crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.

However redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon ( 4) is reached. Reaction with oxygen leads to combustion; with halogens, substitution.

Free radicals, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alknes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alknaes into branched-chain isomers.

In highly brached alkanes, the bond angles may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5 ) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as steric hinderance, and can substantially increase the reactivity.

<h2>Spectroscopic properties</h2>
Virtually all organic compounds contain carbon carbon and carbon hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the absence of other characreistic spectroscopic features.
<h3>Infrared spectroscopy</h3>
The carbon hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960 cm  1 , while the carbon carbon stretching mode absorbes between 800 and 1300 cm  1 . The carbon hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450 cm  1  and 1375 cm  1 , while methylene groups show bands at 1465 cm  1  and 1450 cm  1 . Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725 cm  1 .
<h3>NMR spectroscopy</h3>
The proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at   H  = 0 1. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon:   C  = 8 30 (methyl), 15 55 (methylene), 20 60 (methyne). The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of nuclear Overhauser enhancement and the long relaxation time: it can be missed in routine spectra.

<h3>Mass spectrometry</h3>
Alkanes have a high ionisation energy, and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (M 15) is often absent, and other fragment are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH 2 -groups.

<h1>Reactions</h1>
<h2>Reactions with oxygen</h2>
All alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction, although they become increasing difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:
:2C n H 2n+2  + (3n+1)O 2    2(n+1)H 2 O + 2nCO 2 
In the absence of sufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed, as shown below for methane:
:2CH 4  + 3O 2    2CO + 4H 2 O
:CH 4  + O 2    C + 2H 2 O
Alkanes usually burn with a non-luminous flame with very little soot formation.

The standard enthalpy change of combustion,   c H  o  , for alkanes increases by about 650 kJ/mol per CH 2  group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of   c H  o   than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.

<h2>Reactions with halogens</h2>
Alkanes react with halogens in a so-called halogenation reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced, or substituted, by halogen atoms. Free radicals are the reactive species which participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly exothermic, and can lead to an explosion.

The chain mechanism is as follows, using the chlorination of methane as a typical example:
:1. Initiation: splitting of a chlorine molecule to form two chlorine atoms, initiated by ultraviolet radiation. A chlorine atom has an unpaired electron and acts as a free radical.
::Cl 2    2Cl 
:2. Propagation (two steps): a hydrogen atom is pulled off from methane then the methyl radical pulls a Cl  from Cl 2 .
::CH 4  + Cl    CH 3   + HCl
::CH 3   + Cl 2    CH 3 Cl + Cl  
:This results in the desired product plus another chlorine radical. This radical will then go on to take part in another propagation reaction causing a chain reaction. If there is sufficient chlorine, other products such as CH 2 Cl 2  may be formed.
:3. Termination: recombination of two free radicals:
::Cl  + Cl    Cl 2 ; or
::CH 3   + Cl    CH 3 Cl; or
::CH 3   + CH 3     C 2 H 6 .
:The last possibilty in the termination step will result in an impurity in the final mixture; notably this results in an organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants.

In the case of methane or ethane, all the hydrogen atoms are equivalent and have an equal chance of being replaced. This leads to what is known as a statistical product distribution. For propane and higher alkanes, the hydrogen atoms which form part of CH 2  (or CH) groups are preferentially replaced.

The reactivity of the different halogens varies considerably: the relative rates are: fluorine (108) &gt; chlorine (1) &gt; bromine (7 10  11 ) &gt; iodine (2 10  22 ). Hence the reaction of alkanes with fluorine is difficult to control, that with chlorine is moderate to fast, that with bormine is slow and requires high levels of UV irradiation while the reaction with iodine is practically non-existent and thermodynamically unfavorable.

This reactions is an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons.

<h2>Cracking and reforming</h2>
&quot;Cracking&quot; breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermic or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism, that is, bonds break symmetrically and thus pairs of free radicals are formed. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts (usually solid acids such as silica-alumina and zeolites) which promote a heterolytic (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C-C scission in position beta (i.e., cracking) and intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding reactive intermediates (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.

Here is an example of cracking with butane CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 3

* 1st possibility (48%): breaking is done on the CH 3 -CH 2  bond.

CH 3 * / *CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 3

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an alkene: 
CH 4  + CH 2 =CH-CH 3

* 2nd possibility (38%): breaking is done on the CH 2 -CH 2  bond.

CH 3 -CH 2 * / *CH 2 -CH 3

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkane and an alkene
from different types: CH 3 -CH 3  + CH 2 =CH 2

* 3rd possibility (14%): breaking of a C-H bond

after a certain number of steps, we will obtain an alkene and hydrogen gas: CH 2 =CH-CH 2 -CH 3  + H 2

<h2>Other reactions</h2>

Alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen. Alkanes can by chlorosulfonated and nitrated, although both reactions require special conditions. The fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance.

<h1>Hazards</h1>
Methane is explosive in when mixed with air (1 8% CH 4 ) and is a strong greenhouse gas: other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air. The lighter liquid alkanes are highly flammable, although this risk decreases with the length of the carbon chain. Pentane, hexane and heptane are classed as dangerous for the environment and harmful: octane is also classed as harmful. The straight chain isomer of hexane is a neurotoxin, and therefore rarely used commercially.

<h1>Alkanes in nature</h1>

Although alkanes occur in nature in various way, they do not rank biologically among the essential materials. Cycloalkanes with 14 to 18 carbon atoms occur in musk, extracted from deer of the family Moschidae. All further information refers to acyclic alkanes.

<h2>Bacteria and archaea</h2>

Methanogenic archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in the Earth&apos;s atmosphere.
Certain types of bacteria can metabolise alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-nembered chains.

On the other hand certain archaea, the methanogens, produce large quantites of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidised oranic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen:
:CO 2  + 4H 2    CH 4  + 2H 2 O

Methanogens are also the producers marsh gas in wetlands, and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year the atmospheric content of this gas was produced practically exclusively by them. The methane output of cattle and other herbivores, which can release up to 150 litres per day, and of termites, is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans. Methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle, with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.

<h2>Fungi and plants</h2>

Water forms droplets on a thin film of alkane wax on the skin of the apple.
Alkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms: fungi, plants and animals. Some specialised yeasts, e.g. Candida tropicale, Pichia sp., Rhodotorula sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon and/or energy. The fungus Amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer-chain alkanes in aviation fuel, and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.

In plants it is the solid long-chain alkanes that are found; they form a firm layer of wax, the cuticle, over areas of the plant exposed to the air. This protects the plant against water loss, while preventing the leaching of important minerals by the rain. It is also a protection against bacteria, fungi and harmful insects the latter sink with their legs into the soft waxlike substance and have difficulty moving. The shining layer on fruits such as apples consists of long-chain alkanes. The carbon chains are usually between twenty and thirty carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants from fatty acids. The exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species-dependent, but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions, temperature or humidity.

<h2>Animals</h2>

Alkanes are found in animal products, although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons. On example is the shark liver oil, which is approximately 14% pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane, C 19 H 40 ). Their occurrence is more important in pheromones, chemical messenger materials, on which above all insects are dependent for communication. With some kinds, as the support beetle Xylotrechus colonus, primarily pentacosane (C 25 H 52 ), 3-methylpentaicosane (C 26 H 54 ) and 9-methylpentaicosane (C 26 H 54 ), they are transferred by body contact. With others like the tsetse fly Glossina morsitans morsitans, the pheromone contians the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C 18 H 38 ), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C 39 H 80 ), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C 39 H 80 ) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C 40 H 82 ), and acts by smell over longer distances, a useful characteristic for pest control.

<h2>Ecological relations</h2>

Early spiedr orchid (Ophrys sphegodes)
One example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the sand bee (Andrena nigroaenea) and the early spider orchid (Ophrys sphegodes); the latter is dependent for pollination on the former. Also, sand bees use pheromones for partner identification; in the case of A. nigroaenea, the females use a mixture of tricosane (C 23 H 48 ), pentacosane (C 25 H 52 ) and heptacosane (C 27 H 56 ) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odour. The orchid takes advantage of this circumstance parts of its flower  not only resemble the appearance of sand bees, but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio. As a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempte to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavour is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen, which will be disseminated after the frustrated departure of the male to different blooms.

:This article is about the legal term. For other usages see Appeal (disambiguation).

An appeal is the act or fact of challenging a judicially cognizable and binding judgment to a higher judicial authority. In common law jurisdictions, most commonly, this means formally filing a notice of appeal with a lower court, indicating one&apos;s intention to take the matter to the next higher court with jurisdiction over the matter, and then actually filing the appeal with the appropriate appellate court.

In the old English common law the term &quot;appeal&quot; was used to describe a process peculiar to English criminal procedure. It was a right of prosecution possessed as a personal privilege by a party individually aggrieved by a felony, a privilege of which the crown could not directly or indirectly deprive him, since he could use it alike when the prisoner was tried and acquitted, and when he was convicted and pardoned.  It was chiefly known in practice as the privilege of the nearest relation of a murdered person. When in 1729 (after Colonel Oglethorpe&apos;s inquiry and report on the London prisons) Banbridge and other gaolers were indicted for their treatment of prisoners, but were acquitted for deficiency of evidence, appeals for murder were freely brought by relatives of deceased prisoners. In the case of Slaughterford (1708) the accused was charged with murdering a woman whom he had seduced; the evidence was very imperfect, and he was acquitted on indictment. But public indignation being aroused by the atrocities alleged to have been perpetrated, an appeal was brought, and on conviction he was hanged, as his execution was a privilege belonging to the prosecutor, of which the crown could not deprive him by a pardon. In 1818 an appeal was ingeniously met by an offer of battle, since if the appellee were an able-bodied man he had the choice between combat or a jury (see wager). This neutralizing of one obsolete and barbarous process by another called the attention of the legislature to the subject, and appeal in criminal cases, along with trial by battle, was abolished in 1819. The history of this appeal is fully dealt with in Pollock and Maitland, History of English Law, 1898.

In its usual modern sense the term appeal is applied to the proceeding by which the decision of a court of justice is brought for review before another tribunal of higher authority. In Roman jurisprudence it was used in this and in other significations; it was sometimes equivalent to prosecution, or the calling up of an accused person before a tribunal where the accuser appealed to the protection of the magistrate against injustice or oppression. The derivation from appellare (&quot;call&quot;) suggests that its earliest meaning was an urgent outcry or prayer against injustice. During the republic the magistrate was generally supreme within his sphere, and those who felt themselves outraged by injustice threw themselves on popular protection by provocatio, instead of looking to redress from a higher official authority. Under the empire different grades of jurisdiction were established, and the ultimate remedy was an appeal to the emperor; thus Paul, when brought before Festus, appealed unto Caesar. Such appeals were, however, not heard by the emperor in person but by a supreme judge representing him. In the Corpus Juris the appeal to the emperor is called indiscriminately appellatio and provocatio. A considerable portion of the 49th book of the Pandects is devoted to appeals; but little of the practical operation of the system is to be deduced from the propositions there brought together.

During the middle ages full scope was afforded for appeals from the lower to the higher authorities in the church. In matters ecclesiastical, including those matrimonial, testamentary and other departments, which the church ever tried to bring within the operation of the canon law, there were various grades of appeal, ending with the pope. The claims of the church to engross appeals in matters trenching on the temporal rights of princes led to continual conflicts between church and state, terminated in England at the reformation by the suppression in 1534 of appeals to Rome, which had previously been discouraged by legislation of Edward III. and Richard II.

In temporal, as distinct from spiritual matters, it became customary for ambitious sovereigns to encourage appeals from the courts of the crown vassals to themselves as represented by the supreme judges, and Charlemagne usually enjoys the credit of having set the example of this system of centralization by establishing missi dominici. It is not improbable that his claim was suggested or justified by the practice of the Roman empire, to the sovereignty whereof he claimed to be successor.

<h1> England </h1>
When the royal authority in England grew strong as against that of the tenants in capite, the king&apos;s courts in England were more effectively organized, and their net swept wider so as to draw within their cognizance matters previously adjudged in courts baron or courts leet or in the county court, and they acquired authority to supervise and review the decisions of the inferior and local courts, to control and limit their claims to exercise jurisdiction, and to transfer causes from the local to the royal courts. The machinery by which this process was usually effected, under the common law, was not by what is now known as appeal, but by the process of certiorari or writs of error or prohibition. Recourse was also had against the decisions of the royal courts by appeal to the great council of the king, or to parliament as a whole. The supremacy of the king&apos;s courts over all causes, as well ecclesiastical as civil, has been completely established since the reign of Henry VIII., and they have effectually asserted the power to regulate and keep within their proper jurisdiction all other tribunals within the realm. Since that date the organization of judicial tribunals has gradually been changed and improved with the object
# of creating a judicial hierarchy independent of executive control;
# of ensuring that all decisions on questions of law shall be co-ordinated and rendered systematic by correction of the errors and vagaries of subordinate tribunals; and 
# of securing so far as possible uniformity in the judicial interpretation and administration of the law, by creating a supreme appellate tribunal to whose decisions all other tribunals are bound to conform.
It would be undesirable to detail at length the history of appellate jurisdiction in England, involving as it would the discussion in great detail of the history and procedure of English law, and it may suffice to indicate the system of appeals as at present organized, beginning with the lowest courts.

<h2> Justices of the Peace </h2>
The decisions of justices of the peace sitting as courts of summary jurisdiction are subject to review on questions of law only by the High Court of Justice. This review is in a sense consultative, because it is usually effected by means of a case voluntarily stated by the justices at the request of the aggrieved party, in which are set forth the facts as determined by the justices, the questions of law raised and their decision thereon, as to the correctness whereof the opinion of the High Court is invited. The procedure is equally open in criminal and civil matters brought before the justices. But when the justices decline to state a case for the opinion of the High Court, the latter, if review seems desirable, may order the justices to state a case. And the High Court has also power to control the action of justices by prohibiting them from acting in a case beyond their jurisdiction, ordering them to exercise jurisdiction where they have improperly declined (mandamus), or bringing up for review and quashing orders or convictions which they have made in excess of jurisdiction, or in cases in which interested or biassed justices have adjudicated (certiorari). None of these regulative processes exactly corresponds to what is popularly known as an appeal, but in effect if not in form an appeal is thus given.

There is also another form of appeal, in the fullest sense of the term, from the decision of justices sitting as a court of summary jurisdiction to the justices of the same county sitting in general or quarter sessions, or in the case of a borough to the recorder as judge of the borough court of quarter sessions. This form of appeal is in every case the creation of statute: and even in text-books it is hardly possible to find a really complete list of the matters in respect of which such appeal lies. But as regards criminal cases there is an approximately general rule, given by § 19 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act 1879, viz. that an appeal to quarter sessions lies from the conviction or order of a court of summary jurisdiction directing imprisonment without the option of a fine as a punishment for an offence, or for failing to do or to abstain from doing any act required to be done or left undone other than an order for the payment of money, or to find sureties or give security or to enter into a recognizance, or a conviction made on a plea of guilty or admission of the truth of the matter of complaint.

As a general rule, subject to particular statutory exceptions, appeals of this kind are by way of rehearing, i.e. the actor or prosecutor must before the appellate tribunal call his witnesses and prove his case just as if no previous hearing had taken place before the court appealed from (Pritchard, Quarter Sessions Practice, 2nd ed., 461). The only limit is that the appellant must confine himself to the grounds of appeal stated in the notice of appeal given by him.

<h2> Justices in Quarter Sessions </h2>
This tribunal has under the commission of the peace and under statute power to refer questions of difficulty arising before it for decision to the High Court. The old mode of exercising this power was by sending on to assizes indictments raising difficult questions which had been presented at quarter sessions. The High Court has ex officio power to transfer such indictments where the nature of the case and the demands of justice call for such transfer. The quarter sessions had also power under statute on trying an indictment to refer to the court for crown cases reserved (Crown Cases Act 1848), abolished by the Criminal Appeal Act 1907, questions of law which had arisen at the trial, and in all civil cases the quarter sessions has power of its own volition and subject to no direct compulsion to consult the High Court on legal questions of difficulty which have arisen. Until 1894 this jurisdiction was regarded as consultative only. It was and is exercised by stating the facts, of which the court of quarter sessions is the sole judge, and indicating the questions of law arising on the facts, and the view of quarter sessions thereon, and inviting the opinion of the High Court. Under the Judicature Act 1894 cases stated in this way are now treated as &quot;appeals&quot; in the popular sense.

<h2> Inferior Courts of purely Civil Jurisdiction </h2>
An appeal also lies as a general rule to the High Court from the judgment of a county court or of any inferior tribunal having civil jurisdiction.

<h3> County Courts </h3>
Any party to an action or matter in a county court who is dissatisfied with the determination or direction of the judge in law or equity, or upon the admission or rejection of any evidence, may appeal against the decision in the following cases:
# if the amount of claim or counter-claim in the proceeding exceeds £20; or
# in all equity matters or cases in which an injunction has been given; or
# in actions to recover possession of land where questions of title are involved (County Courts Act 1888, § 120).
In the case of a claim below £20 no appeal lies except by the leave of the county court.  The old practice of appeal by way of special case as in appeals from justices has been abolished, and the present procedure is by notice of motion (R.S.C. O. LIX. rr. 10-18).

These appeals are heard in the king&apos;s bench division, except in the case of appeals from judgments of a county court sitting in the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction, which are heard by two or more judges sitting in the probate, divorce and admiralty division. The chancery division has never sat to hear &quot;appeals&quot; from a county court exercising equity jurisdiction; but at times, by prohibition or certiorari, has, in effect, reviewed or restrained excess of jurisdiction by county courts in equity matters.

The decision of the High Court on county court appeals is final unless an appeal to the court of appeal is brought by leave of that court or of the High Court (Judicature Act 1894, § 1, sub. sect. 5; Judicature Act 1873, § 45).

<h3> Other inferior courts of civil jurisdiction </h3>
Appeals from the local courts of record which still survive in certain cities, towns and districts are in a somewhat anomalous position. The general rule is that, unless a statute regulates such appeal, it may be brought in the king&apos;s bench division of the High Court on notice of motion in any case in which, before the Judicature Acts, the court of king&apos;s bench could have reviewed the decision of the inferior court by writ of error. The history of this question is dealt with in Darlow v. Shuttleworth, 1902, 1 K.B. 721.

In the case of the mayor&apos;s court of London, under the local and general statutes regulating that court, the appeal is usually to the king&apos;s bench division, but where there is what is termed &quot;error&quot; on the face of the proceedings of the mayor&apos;s court, the appeal lies direct to the court of appeal as successor of the court of exchequer chamber. Appeals from the Liverpool court of passage and from the chancery courts of the duchies of Lancaster and Durham lie by statute direct to the court of appeal.

<h2> High Court of Justice </h2>
Until the Supreme Court of Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 came into operation, the superior courts in England were imperfectly co-ordinated both as to jurisdiction and appeals. The effect of these acts was to create a Supreme Court of Judicature divided into two main branches, the High Court of Justice, which is an appellate court with respect to the inferior courts already mentioned, and to certain other special courts and persons; and the court of appeal, which is mainly concerned with appeals from the High Court of Justice.

The High Court of Justice acts as an appellate court or court of consultation with reference to courts of summary jurisdiction or quarter sessions and to county courts and other inferior courts of civil jurisdiction in the cases already indicated. The three divisions of the court are somewhat differently placed with reference to appeals.

In the chancery division (made up, in 1908, of six single judge courts) no appeals are heard except from subordinate officials (masters) of the court, or an occasional interference by certiorari or prohibition with a county court.

In the probate, divorce and admiralty division, besides the supervision which may be exercised by a single judge over the subordinate officers of the court (registrars), divisional courts (of two judges) hear appeals from decisions of the county court in admiralty causes, and appeals from justices in cases between husband and wife under the Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act 1895, as amended by the Licensing Act 1902. In the first of these cases the appeal is on law only as in the case of other county court appeals; in the second, the procedure is by rehearing, or reconsideration of the facts as minuted in the court appealed from, and of the law there applied to these facts.

The bulk of the appellate work of the High Court is conducted in the king&apos;s bench division--which, as successor of the old court of king&apos;s bench in the duties of custos morum of the realm, still retains supervisory power over all inferior courts in all cases in which that supervision has not been transferred to the other divisions of the High Court or to the court of appeal, or to the court of criminal appeal.

The king&apos;s bench division exercises appellate jurisdiction in the following cases.

With respect to decisions of justices of the peace sitting at quarter sessions, or as a court of summary jurisdiction, except in the case above stated, the subject matter of appeal is for the most part of a criminal or quasi-criminal character, the civil jurisdiction of justices being comparatively limited. The appeal in such cases is as to matters of law only, the justices&apos; decision on facts not being subject to review.

In the case of the courts above named, the appeal is brought by writ of certiorari, where the jurisdiction of quarter sessions to give the judgment challenged is denied in toto, or in some cases by writ of habeas corpus, where the appellant is in custody under an order of the court appealed from (Judicature Act 1894, § 2). The best example of this is the right of a fugitive criminal committed for extradition to challenge the legality of the decision of the committing magistrate by writ of habeas corpus. Save in cases of want of jurisdiction or refusal to exercise it, no appeal lies from quarter sessions except by consent of the court appealed from, which states the facts as ascertained by the inferior court, and invites the review of the superior court upon the questions of law raised by the facts as found.

Decisions of justices sitting in the exercise of summary jurisdiction are subject to review by a special case in which the justices state the facts found by them and their decision on the points of law, and invite the review of the appellate court on these grounds. Such cases for appeal are usually stated by consent of the justices, but in the event of their refusal the appellate court may order that a case shall be stated.

Decisions of justices in the exercise of summary jurisdiction may also be challenged by writ of certiorari as having been wholly outside their jurisdiction; and in such proceeding the appellate tribunal may review the evidence taken below so far as to ascertain whether the justices have by an erroneous finding of fact enabled themselves to assume a jurisdiction which upon the true facts they did not possess.

Where the decision appealed from is in a criminal cause or matter the decision of the High Court is final. Where it is in a civil matter a further appeal also lies to the court of appeal by leave of the High Court or of the court of appeal (Judicature Act 1873, § 45).

Appeals in criminal cases tried on indictment, criminal information or coroner&apos;s inquisition, stand on a different footing from other appeals.

For many years the question of criminal appeal in general had been a matter of great controversy. As early as 1844 a bill had been unsuccessfully introduced for the purpose of establishing appeal in criminal cases, and from that time up to 1906 nearly thirty bills were brought forward with the same object, but none succeeded in passing. In 1892 the question was referred to the council of judges and favourably reported upon by them. It may be remarked that England was practically the only civilized country in which there was no appeal in criminal cases. It is true there was an appeal on questions of law arising at the trial. But the procedure was intricate and technical, being either
# by writ of error, issued by the consent of the attorney-general (expressed by his fiat), to review errors of law appearing in the record of the trial, or 
# by special case, stated by the judge presiding at the trial, with respect to a question of law raised at the trial. These appeals were heard by the king&apos;s bench division.
Meanwhile there had been a considerable development of public opinion in favour of the establishment of criminal appeal, a development undoubtedly hastened by the report of a committee of inquiry in the case of Adolf Beck (1904), showing clearly that the home office was not a satisfactory tribunal of final appeal. In 1906 the lord chancellor (Lord Loreburn) introduced another criminal appeal bill, which passed the House of Lords, but was dropped in the House of Commons after a first reading. The next year the act (Criminal Appeal Act 1907), which was ultimately carried, was introduced into the House of Commons. By this act a court is established consisting of the lord chief justice and eight judges of the king&apos;s bench division, the jurisdiction of the court for crown cases reserved being transferred to the new court. The court to be duly constituted must consist of not less than three judges and of an uneven number of judges. The court may sit in two or more divisions if the lord chief justice so directs. Its sittings are held in London unless special directions are given by the lord chief justice that it shall sit at some other place. The opinion of the majority of those hearing the case determines any question before the court, and judgment is pronounced by the president (who is the lord chief justice or senior member present), unless in questions of law, when, if it is convenient that separate judgments should be pronounced by the members of the court, they may be so pronounced. The judgment of the court of criminal appeal is final, except where the decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance, and a certificate must be obtained from the attorney-general to that effect. The court of criminal appeal is a superior court of record. An appeal may be made either against conviction or against sentence. A person convicted on indictment may appeal either on a question of law alone or of fact alone, or on a question of mixed law and fact. On a point of law a prisoner has an unqualified right of appeal, on a question of fact or of mixed law and fact there is a right of appeal only if leave be obtained from the court of criminal appeal or a certificate be granted by the judge who tried the prisoner that it is a fit case for appeal. The court is given a wide discretion as to whether a conviction may be sustained or set aside. The court may allow the appeal if they think that the verdict of the jury should be set aside because it is unreasonable, or because it cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any point of law, or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice. Power is given to the court to dismiss the appeal if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred, even though they are of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant. The sentence passed at the trial may be quashed by the appeal court and such other sentence (whether more or less severe) warranted in law by the verdict substituted. Notice of appeal or notice of application for leave to appeal must be given within ten days of the date of conviction; where a conviction involves sentence of death or corporal punishment the sentence must not be executed until after the expiration of ten days, and, if notice of appeal is given, not until after the determination of the appeal or the final dismissal of the application for leave to appeal. The act gives the court power to order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the court, and to receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness who is a competent but not compellable witness. If any question arises on the appeal involving prolonged examination of documents or accounts or any scientific or local investigation, which the court thinks cannot be conveniently conducted before it, the matter may be referred to a special commissioner appointed by the court, and the court may act on the report of that commissioner if it thinks fit. An appellant is given the right to be present on the hearing of his appeal, if he desires it, except where the appeal is on some ground involving a question of law alone, but rules of court may provide for his presence in such a case, or the court may give him leave. The act requires shorthand notes to be taken of the proceedings at the trial of any person, who, if convicted, would have a right to appeal under the act. Nothing in the act affects the prerogative of mercy, and the home secretary may, if he thinks fit, at any time refer a case to the court of criminal appeal.

<h2> The Court of Appeal </h2>
The court of appeal, constituted under the Judicature Acts, is one of the two permanent divisions of the Supreme Court of Judicature. As now constituted the court consists of ex officio members and five ordinary members, styled lords justices of appeal. The ex officio members are the lord chancellor, every person who has held that office, the lord chief justice, the master of the rolls, and the president of the probate, &amp;c., division.

The ordinary business of the court is carried on by the lords justices under the presidency of the master of the rolls, who in 1881 ceased to be a judge of the High Court (Judicature Act 1881, § 2). The court usually sits in two divisions of three judges, but on occasion a third court can be formed, with the assistance of the other ex officio judges, in the absence of the ordinary judges from illness or public engagements, or to deal with arrears of business. The quorum for final appeals is three, for interlocutory appeals two judges.

The court of appeal has succeeded to the appellate authority exercised
# in the case of equity and bankruptcy matters by the lord chancellor and the lords justices of appeal in chancery (Judicature Act 1873, § 18);
# in the case of common law matters, by the court of exchequer chamber, as a court of error, and the superior courts of common law sitting to review the decisions of single judges of these courts sitting with or without a jury at first instance in civil actions;
# in the case of divorce or probate causes by the full court of divorce (Judicature Act 1881, § 9);
# in the case of admiralty causes by the king in council or the judicial committee of the privy council;
# in the case of applications for new trials in jury actions by the king&apos;s bench division (Judicature Act 1890, § 1).

The court never had jurisdiction to hear an appeal in any criminal cause or matter, but was able to review by writ of error decisions of the king&apos;s bench division in such cases, unless the court for crown cases reserved had dealt with the question under the Crown Cases Act 1848. This procedure has been abolished by the Criminal Appeal Act 1907. Instances of procedure by writ of error were rare. Those best worth notice are the cases of the Tichborne claimant on his conviction of perjury, and the case of C. Bradlaugh on the sufficiency of the indictment against him for publishing the Fruits of Philosophy.

The appellate jurisdiction of the court as now exercised entitles the court to hear and determine
# appeals from every judgment or decree of every division of the High Court in all civil cases in which such judgment is not declared final by statute;
# applications for a new trial in civil cases tried in the king&apos;s bench division by judge and jury which, until 1890, were dealt with by two or more judges in that division;
# appeals in matters of civil practice and procedure from decisions of a single judge in chambers, which, until 1894, were dealt with in a divisional court or by a judge in open court;
# appeals from the chancery courts of Durham (Palatine Court of Durham Act 1889) and Lancaster (act of 1890, c. 23) and the Liverpool court of passage (Anderson v. Dean, 1894, 2 Q.B. 222), and on error in a record of the mayor&apos;s court of London (Le Blanche v. Heaton Telegram Co., 1876, 1 Ex.D. 408); and from county courts under the Agricultural Holdings Acts and Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts;
# appeals on questions of law from decisions of the railway commissioners in England (Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1888).

The court of appeal also exercises the lunacy jurisdiction of the lord chancellor, but in regard to this the jurisdiction of the court is for the most part original and not appellate.

The jurisdiction of the court of appeal is excluded or limited
in the following cases:--
# judgments of the High Court--
## where its jurisdiction is consultative only;
## where there is an appeal to the High Court from an inferior court of civil jurisdiction;
## where there is an appeal to the High Court from any court of person,
#: unless in cases (2) and (3) leave be obtained of the court by which the order is made, or of the court of appeal;
# orders of the High Court in registration and election cases except with the like leave;
# orders made by consent of parties, or as to costs only which by law are left to the discretion of the court;
# certain interlocutory orders mentioned in § 1 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Procedure) Act 1894, except by leave of the judge appealed from or of the court of appeal;
# orders of the admiralty division in cases of prize, the appeal from which lies to His Majesty in Council;
# where the decision of any court whose jurisdiction was transferred to the High Court is declared by statute to be final;
# matters which from their nature were not appealable to any court before the Judicature Acts, or in which the court of appeal has no means of enforcing or executing its judgment. For example, it was held in the House of Lords, in Cox v. Hakes, 1890, 15 A.C. 506, that no appeal lies from the order of a judge discharging a prisoner under a writ of habeas corpus. &quot;If,&quot; said Lord Herschell, &quot;the contention of the respondent is to prevail, the statute has effected a grave constitutional change&quot;; and later, &quot;if&quot; the High Court &quot;has inherited the combined powers of the courts whose functions were transferred to it, but none of them had any jurisdiction or authority to review a discharge by a competent court under a writ of habeas corpus, or to enforce the arrest of one thus freed from custody...it seems to me to follow, that however wrong the court of appeal might think a discharge to have been, it would have been powerless to order a rearrest, or at least to enforce such an order.&quot;

The procedure of the court of appeal is regulated by the rules of the Supreme Court. A distinction is drawn between appeals from a final judgment or order (which, unless the parties consent to a smaller quorum, must be heard by three judges) and an appeal from an interlocutory order (which may be determined by two judges of the court of appeal).

In the case of appeals from a final or interlocutory &quot;judgment,&quot; or from an order, including applications for a new trial, the appeal must be brought within three months from the time when the judgment or order is signed, entered or otherwise perfected, or in the case of refusal of an application from the date of refusal. The appeal is by notice of motion, which except in cases of application for a new trial, need not state the grounds of appeal. Fourteen clear days&apos; notice of the motion must be given by the appellant to the other party, the respondent.

In the case of appeals from an interlocutory order, or from a final order, or from an order made in any matter which is not an action, or from an order made in chambers, the appeal must be brought within fourteen days by motion, of which four clear days&apos; notice must be given by the appellant to all parties directly affected by the appeal. Controversies have arisen as to the meaning of the term &quot;interlocutory,&quot; which (in the absence of any authoritative definition) the court of appeal settles as they arise. The test most generally accepted is that a judgment or order is final if, as made, it finally disposes of the rights of the parties in a manner equally conclusive between them. The court may by special leave allow appeals of either class to be brought after the time above limited. The respondent may by proper notice bring a cross appeal against any portion of the judgment or order made below with which he is dissatisfied. The court has power to order the appellant to find security for the costs of an appeal, if special circumstances, such as insolvency or poverty or foreign domicile or the like, make the giving of security desirable. The court of appeal &quot;rehears&quot; the case. Under ordinary circumstances it does not permit a new case to be set up inconsistent with the case as presented below; and it is content with the judges&apos; notes, or a transcript of the evidence given below, and with a note or transcript of the judgment appealed from, but has power on special grounds to receive fresh evidence either viva voce or on affidavit. The court may call in for its assistance assessors who are experts on the matters of fact or science involved in the appeal, and usually does so in cases arising out of collisions at sea.

The court of appeal may make any order which it deems just as to the costs of the whole or any part of an appeal, except possibly in the case of certain appeals in matters on the crown side of the High Court, as to which some doubt still exists. In practice the costs follow the event, unless the court in a particular case makes an order to the contrary.

A decision of the court of appeal is final in appeals from the High Court in bankruptcy, unless leave be given to appeal to the House of Lords (§ 104, Bankruptcy Act 1883), and in divorce appeals, except where the decision either is upon the grant or refusal of a decree for dissolution or nullity of marriage, or for a declaration of legitimacy, or is upon any question of law on which the court gives leave to appeal (Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1881, § 9); but no further appeal to the House of Lords lies, even with leave of the court of appeal, on appeals from the High Court sitting as a court of appeal from county courts in bankruptcy. With these exceptions there is now a right of appeal from every order of the court of appeal to the House of Lords.

<h2> The House of Lords </h2>
The House of Lords has for centuries been the court of last resort, and is still the final court of appeal from the chief courts in the United Kingdom. The origin of the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords was undoubtedly of that partly feudal and partly popular character already alluded to, which made the suitor seek from the high court of parliament the justice denied elsewhere in the baronial courts or by the king&apos;s judges. The lords exercised the mixed function of jurymen and judges, and, as in judgments on impeachment, might be influenced by private or party considerations, debating and dividing on the question before the House. A revolution was silently accomplished, however, by which the function of reviewing the decisions of the courts fell entirely to the lawyers raised to the peerage, while the unprofessional lords only attended to give the sanction of a quorum to the proceedings, and the House has always had the right to invoke the assistance of the judges of the superior courts to advise on the questions of law raised by an appeal. The letters and memoirs, so late as Queen Anne&apos;s reign, show that party or personal influence and persuasion were employed to procure votes on appeals, as they have been in later times on railway or other local bills. The last instance probably in which a strong division of opinion was manifested among the unprofessional lords was the celebrated Douglas cause in 1769, when the House was addressed by the dukes of Newcastle and Bedford, but was led by the authoritative opinion of Lord Mansfield on the effect of the evidence--an opinion which was treated rather as that of a political partisan than of a judge. The case of Daniel O&apos;Connell and others, brought up on writ of error from the queen&apos;s bench in Ireland in 1844, may be said to have finally established the precedent that the judgments of the House of Lords were to be given solely by the law lords. On that occasion there was a difference of opinion among the law lords themselves. The judgment of the majority of the House was strongly against the political feeling of the government and of the peers as a body, while the law lords who carried the decision had been appointed by previous governments opposed in politics to the existing cabinet. But all these temptations to a party vote by the unprofessional members were resisted.

By § 20 of the act of 1873, the appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords (so far as it affects England) was abolished, but this section was repealed by the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. Under that act and an amending act of 1887, the appellate business of the House of Lords is conducted solely by the law lords, though lay peers may still sit (Bradlaugh v. Clarke, 1882, 8 App. Cas. 354). No appeal may be heard or determined except in the presence of not less than three of the following persons:--
# the lord chancellor;
# the lords of appeal, four of whom are appointed under the act from among persons who hold, or have held, high judicial office, or, at the date of appointment, have been in practice for not less than fifteen years as barristers in England or Ireland, or as advocates in Scotland;
# such peers of parliament as hold, or have held, high judicial office. By &quot;high judicial office&quot; is meant the office of lord chancellor of Great Britain or Ireland, lord of appeal in ordinary, paid judge of the judicial committee or member of that committee, or judge of one of the superior courts of Great Britain or Ireland.

An appeal lies to the House of Lords 
# from any order or judgment of the court of appeal in England except as above stated;
# from a judgment or order of any court in Scotland or Ireland from which error or an appeal to the House of Lords lay by common law or statute immediately before the 1st of November 1876.
No appeals are heard from the decision of courts in criminal cases. The House of Lords has an indirect power by standing orders to admit appeals from Scotland or Ireland which under former law or practice could not be admitted (Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876, § 12). The procedure on appeals is regulated by standing orders of the House. The proceedings are commenced by petition of appeal, which must be lodged with the clerk of the parliaments within one year from the date of the last judgment it appealed from. Security for costs (£200) must be given by bond or lodgment of the money, unless dispensed with by the House on the ground of poverty (act of 1893). Each party lodges a printed case signed and certified by counsel, containing a resumé of the matters to be discussed and of the contentions for or against the allowance of the appeal. The hearing is before three or more law lords, who may call in nautical assessors in admiralty cases (acts of 1893 and 1894). It is not public in the full sense of the term, as persons not concerned in the appeal can attend only by consent of the House. The House pronounces the judgment which in the opinion of the majority of the law lords should have been pronounced below, and has jurisdiction in the case of all appeals to give or refuse costs to the successful party. The costs of the appeal if given are taxed by the officers of the House. The jurisdiction as to costs does not directly arise under any statute (see West Ham Guardians v. Bethnal Green Churchwardens, 1896, A.C. 477).

<h2> Appeals to the King in Council </h2>
The decisions of ecclesiastical courts when acting within the limits of their jurisdiction, and the decisions of courts in the king&apos;s dominions outside the United Kingdom, and of courts in foreign countries set up under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, cannot be dealt with by the House of Lords or any of the ordinary tribunals of any part of the United Kingdom. The power once claimed by the court of king&apos;s bench in England to control the courts of Ireland has lapsed, and its power to intervene in colonial cases is limited to the grant of the writ of habeas corpus to a possession in which no court exists having power to issue that writ or one of like effect (Habeas Corpus Act 1862). As regards all British possessions, the appeal to the king in council is in its origin and nature like that of the provincials unto Caesar, and flows from the royal prerogative to admit appeals. With the growth of the British empire it has been found necessary to create a comparatively constant and stable tribunal to advise the king in the exercise of this prerogative. For this purpose the judicial committee of the privy council was created in 1833. In 1851, and again in 1870, it was reorganized, and by acts of 1876, 1887 and 1898 it received its present form. The committee consists of the president of the council, and of the following persons, if privy councillors--the lord chancellor and ex-chancellors of Great Britain and of Ireland, the four lords of appeal in ordinary, the lords justices of appeal in England or retired lords justices of appeal in England, and persons who hold or have held the office
# of judge of the High Court of Justice or the court of appeal in England or Ireland, or of the court of session in Scotland;
# any person who is or has been chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada or of a superior court of any province of Canada, of any of the Australian states (except Fiji and Papua), or of New Zealand or the Cape of Good Hope or Natal. The number of persons of this class who may be members at once is limited to five (1895, c. 44);
# provision is also made for the payment of two privy councillors who have been judges in India who attend the privy council.

Numerous as are the members of the committee, the quorum is three. One or more of the lords of appeal in ordinary usually attend at every hearing, but the composition of the committee is very fluctuating. Appeals from the British dominions abroad lie in criminal as well as civil matters. The right of appeal is regulated as to most possessions by order in council, and in some cases is limited by imperial or colonial statute. Appeals are on fact as well as on law, but the committee rarely if ever disturbs the concurrent judgments on facts of two colonial courts. In the case of admiralty appeals from colonial or consular courts, naval assessors may be called in. The committee also hears (with the aid of ecclesiastical assessors) appeals from ecclesiastical courts. The judgment of the committee is in the form of a report and advice to the king, which is read by one of the members sitting, and no indication is given as to whether the members present are unanimous. Effect is given to the advice by orders in council dismissing or allowing the appeal, and giving direction as to the payment of costs and as to the further proceedings to be taken in the colonial courts.

The procedure of the committee is on the same lines as that on appeals to the House of Lords; no well-arranged code of practice existed however up to the end of 1908, and new rules were then being proposed on the subject. The appeal is commenced by a petition of appeal, and by the giving of security for costs. In colonial appeals printed cases are lodged containing a summary of the contentions of the parties, and with this a printed copy of the record of the proceedings and documents used in the courts appealed from. The hearing is in the privy council chamber and is not public. When an appeal is called on, the counsel and parties are summoned into the chamber, and when the arguments are concluded they are requested to retire. The appeals to the king in council from colonial states having a federal constitution, like Canada and Australia, stand in an exceptional position. The act creating the Supreme Court of Canada purports to make the decision of that court final. But it is still the practice to admit by special leave a prerogative appeal from the court, and to entertain appeals from courts of the provinces of Canada direct to the king in council, without requiring them to go to the Supreme Court. The constitution of the Australian Commonwealth contemplates (§73) the possibility of restricting appeals to the king in council from the supreme courts of Australia, and sec. 74 forbids appeals to the king in council except by leave of the High Court of Australia from decision of that court on any question however arising as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of the commonwealth and those of any state or states, or as to the limits inter se of the constitutional powers of any two or more states. The exact effect of these enactments and of Australian legislation under §73 is a matter of controversy.

<h1> Scotland </h1>
In Scotland the ordinary appellate tribunal for decisions of inferior courts and of the lords ordinary is the court of session, which for appellate purposes sits in two divisions. Appeals from inferior tribunals in criminal cases go before the judges of the court of session sitting in the High Court of Justiciary. The court of session was in its original constitution a committee of parliament for the performance of its judicial functions, and an appeal to parliament was consequently anomalous. In the reign of Charles II., however, the courts grew so intolerably corrupt that a determined effort was made to have their judgments overturned, by an appeal which was strictly of the old character of a cry for protection against flagrant injustice. It was called a &quot;protest for remeid of law,&quot; and was inserted as one of the national claims in the Petition of Right at the revolution. The treaty of union is silent as to appeals, though definitely excluding the right of English courts to interfere with Scottish courts or cases. The House of Lords has since the Union acted without challenge as the final appellate tribunal for Scotland in civil causes; but has always declined jurisdiction in Scottish criminal cases.

<h1> Ireland </h1>
The Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Acts have remodelled the courts and appellate system of Ireland on the same lines as those of England. The High Court of Justice in Ireland now consists of two divisions only, the chancery division, which has little or no appellate functions, and the king&apos;s bench division, which has for Ireland substantially the same power of reviewing and correcting the decisions of inferior courts as has the corresponding court in England. To this there is one exception, that appeals from a county court in Ireland may be heard on circuit by a single judge of assize. In Ireland there is also a court of appeal, created in 1877, whose jurisdiction and procedure follow the same lines as that of the English court of appeal.

<h1> France </h1>
The court of last resort in France for all cases, whether civil or criminal (en matière criminelle, correctionnelle et de police), is the cour de cassation, which sits in Paris. It is a court of error for the review of all judgments of tribunals of last resort (except juges de paix in certain cases), and for the transfer of causes from one court to another when justice so demands, and to determine conflicts of jurisdiction (Law 1 Dec. 1790). Ordinarily it is confined to errors of law and procedure, but where evidence not available below is brought before the court, it may send the case back for retrial or give the appropriate final judgment, as in the case of Dreyfus (1906). It also hears appeals from courts martial.

Next to the cour de cassation are the courts of appeal, which have jurisdiction to hear appeals
# in civil matters from courts of first instance, juges de paix, and where the amount in dispute exceeds £60 from commercial courts, tribunaux de commerce (Civil Proc. Code, arts. 443-475);
# in criminal matters from tribunaux correctionnels (Com. Proc. Code, arts. 202-235).
The appeal is both on fact and on law, and applies to interlocutory or preparatory as well as to final judgments.

<h1> Spain </h1>
In Spain the jurisdiction and procedure with reference to appeals is on the same lines as in France. As regards civil matters it is regulated by title 21 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appeal to the supreme court is for the most part on questions of law (por infraccion de ley o de doctrina); but the court has also power to review judgments on materials not available at the first hearing (arts. 1796, 1801).

<h1> British India </h1>
In British India complete and systematic provision was made for appeals both in civil and in criminal cases by the Procedure Codes (Civil of 1882, with subsequent amendments, and Criminal of 1898), and also to some extent by the charters of the high courts of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras (see Ilbert, Government of India, Oxford, 1898, p. 137). In addition, the decisions of subordinate tribunals might be revised by a superior tribunal proprio motu, or reviewed in a proper case by the tribunal which had given them; and provision was made for the consultation of a superior by an inferior tribunal in cases of legal difficulty. The policy of admitting so many appeals was criticized. But with an enormous population which had no representative institutions it had been deemed wise to provide ample means of correcting judicial errors at the instance not only of the aggrieved person but also at the instance of the supervising judicial authorities, as a means of ensuring regularity and propriety in the conduct of judicial business by subordinate judges in out-of-the-way districts.

<h2> Civil Appeals </h2>
# Except where otherwise expressly provided by the Civil Procedure Code, or by any other law for the time being in force, an appeal lies from the whole or part of any decree, whether made ex parte or inter partes, of a court exercising original jurisdiction (Civil Procedure Code, § 540). By &quot;decree&quot; is meant the final expression of an adjudication upon a right claimed or defence set up in a civil court, when such adjudication, so far as regards the court expressing it, decides the suit (§ 2). The appeal is both on facts and on law. The procedure on the appeal is prescribed by c. 41 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the directions of the code deal even with the language of the judgment on appeal and the matters to be stated therein.
# Decrees passed on an appeal to any court in India subordinate to a High Court are as a general rule subject to appeal to the High Court on the grounds
## that they are contrary to a specified law, or usage having the force of law;
## that they have failed to determine some material issue of law, or usage having the force of law;
## of substantial error or defect in procedure prescribed by the code or other law which might possibly have produced error or defect in the decision of the case upon the merits (§ 584). The procedure on these appeals is regulated by c. 42 of the Civil Procedure Code.
# Appeals from orders which do not fall within the definition of decrees are allowed in the cases specified in § 588 of the code. The procedure with respect to these appeals is on the same lines as that on appeals against decrees (§ 590). Provision is made (by c. 44) for allowing appeals in forma pauperis after certain preliminary inquiries. In the High Courts appeals lie from the decision of one judge to two or more judges of the High Court, whose decision has effect as a judgment of the full court. Appeals, in civil cases, from the courts of India to the king in council are regulated by c. 45 of the Civil Procedure Code. The appealable amount is for most cases Rs.10,000 or a claim or question as to property of like amount.

Besides the provisions stated as to appeals, Indian courts had power in certain contingencies to review their own decisions (§ 623). An inferior court may also refer cases of difficulty to the High Court on a statement of the facts as found in the referring court and of the opinion thereon of that Court (§§ 617-620); and in cases in which no appeal lies to the High Court, that court may call for the record of any case in which the court below appears to have acted without jurisdiction or failed to exercise its jurisdiction, or to have exercised its jurisdiction illegally or with material illegality (§622).

<h2> Criminal Matters </h2>
Criminal jurisdiction in British India was exercised by magistrates of the first, second and third class, by sessions courts, and the high or chief courts of the presidencies or provinces (Criminal Procedure Code of 1898). The higher judges in a district had the power of revising those decisions which are not absolutely summary of the judges of the classes below them in the same district; i.e. the sessions judge can revise the decisions of a first-class magistrate, and the High Court those of a sessions judge (§ 435). Inferior tribunals can also refer questions of law to the High Court (§§ 432, 433); and where a sentence of death is passed, or a sessions judge differs from the jury (§ 307), the matter must be referred to the High Court. On matters of reference or revision the parties have no right to be heard.

Provision is also made for appeals by c. 31 of the Code. Appeals from second- or third-class magistrates are dealt with by the district (first-class) magistrate (§ 407). Persons convicted on trial by assistant sessions judges or first-class magistrates, except in cases where the punishment is very small, have an appeal to the sessions judge (§§ 408, 413). A person convicted on trial by the sessions judge has an appeal to the High Court (§ 410), but where he has pleaded guilty the only point on which appeal is open is the legality or extent of sentence (§ 412). Special provision is made as to appeals by persons born in Europe (whether British subjects or not) and Americans (§§ 408, 415, and c. 33).

In criminal cases there is a right of appeal to the king in council in certain cases provided for by the charters of the chartered high courts (see Ilbert, Government of India, Oxford, 1898, p. 137).

An appeal also lies in certain cases from the courts of British officers in feudatory states of India to a high court in India, and from the courts of Aden and Zanzibar and British East Africa to the High Court of Bombay. Appeals do not lie from the courts of native states to British courts in India, though in some cases there is an appeal of a political rather than judicial nature from the judicial tribunals of feudatory states; e.g. in the case of Kathiawar (Hemchand Derchand v. Azam Sakarlal; 1906. L.R.
A.C. 212).

<h1> Canada </h1>
In Canada each province has the regulation of its own courts of justice. In Ontario the judiciary are organized, under the Provincial Judicature Acts, in much the same manner as in England; and the review of decisions of inferior courts (by appeal or other proceedings based on English practice) is in the hands of the High Court of Justice, subject to appeal to the provincial court of appeal. In Quebec the highest court (king&apos;s bench), besides its original jurisdiction, has appellate jurisdiction over the superior court (see Quebec Civil Procedure Code, art. 1114 et seq.). The jurisdiction is exercised by writ of error or by appeal, according to the nature of the decision appealed from. The judges of the superior court have also, under art. 494, power to review before three judges decisions of a judge of that court or of a circuit court (arts. 494-504). Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and British Columbia have supreme courts with appellate authority over decisions of single judges of the court and over inferior tribunals in the province. Appeals lie from the highest courts of each province, in civil matters, to the Supreme Court of Canada, or to the king in council in cases falling within the orders in council applying to each province, but in criminal matters to the king in council. From the Supreme Court of Canada no appeal lies as of right to the king in council (Dominion Act 1875, 38 Vic. c.11, § 47), and the royal prerogative of granting special leave to appeal is sparingly exercised. The principles on which the judicial committee acts in advising for or against the grant of special leave in civil case are stated in Daily Telegraph Newspaper Co. v. M&apos;Laughlin, 1904, L.R. A.C. 776, It is, however, as before, quite common for appeals to be brought direct to the privy council from the provincial courts without resort to the Dominion court (see Wheeler, Privy Council Law, p. 955).

<h1> Australia </h1>
Each of the states of the Australian Commonwealth has its own supreme court. The Commonwealth parliament constituted in 1903 a High Court for Australia, which, besides its original federal jurisdiction, is also a court of appeal from the supreme courts of the constitutional states, or from any state court from which an appeal lay to the king in council at the establishment of the Commonwealth. The jurisdiction of the court is defined by the Judiciary Act of 1903, by which it is created. The right of appeal is given both as to criminal and civil matters.

<h1> South Africa </h1>
In Cape Colony and Natal the appellate courts are the supreme courts, subject to further appeal in certain cases to the king in council. The superior courts of Cape Colony are empowered to review the proceedings of all inferior courts in the colony and its dependencies in cases where no appeal lies. There was for a time an appeal from the High Court of Orange River Colony to the supreme court of the Transvaal, and from that court (whether acting for its own colony or on appeal from the Orange Colony), an appeal to the king in council. In other colonies the provisions as to appeal follow more or less closely the lines of English law and procedure as to appeals, and in all cases the ultimate appeal is to the king in council.

<h1> United States </h1>
In the American courts the term &quot;appeal&quot; covers
# a removal of a cause to a higher court for retrial on all the questions of law or fact involved, or
# taking up points of law only by proceedings in error, for revision by a higher court.
Decrees in admiralty, bankruptcy and equity, in the federal courts, are the subjects of an appeal; judgments in actions at law, of a writ of error. On an equity appeal the evidence taken at the original hearing is reported at length to the appellate court, and it has the right to review the conclusions of fact reached by the court below and come to different ones. This, however, is seldom done, the appeal being almost always decided on points of law based upon the conclusions of fact reached in the original hearing. In admiralty appeals the conclusions of fact reached by the trial court are specially set forth, and are final.

&quot;Appeal&quot; in many of the states is the general term for reviewing any judgment of an inferior court on assignments of error. It is also often used to signify a mode of reviewing proceedings of municipal bodies, affecting the interests of particular persons, e.g. in matters of licences or assessments.

In criminal prosecutions an appeal, or writ of error on points of law, is almost everywhere allowed by statute to the defendant, and often to the state. (United States v. Sanges, 144 United States Reports, 310; State v. Lee, 65 Connecticut Reports, 265.)

By the constitution of the United States the Supreme Court is vested with &quot;appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations, as the Congress shall make.&quot; This provision is held not to create but only to authorize the creation of the jurisdiction. In the words of Chancellor Kent, &quot;If congress had not provided any rule to regulate the proceedings in appeal, the court could not exercise an appellate jurisdiction: and, if a rule be provided, the court could not depart from it.&quot; In pursuance of this principle, the Supreme Court decided in Clarke v. Bazadone that a writ of error did not lie to that court from a court of the United States territory north-west of the Ohio, because the act had not authorized an appeal or writ of error from such a court (Commentaries, i. 324). The appellate jurisdiction of the court is now regulated by title 13 chap. ii. of the Revised Statutes of the United States (1873), §§ 690-710; and by the acts enumerated at p. 901 of the Revised Statutes, United States, 1873 to 1891. Under these statutes the Supreme Court may entertain appeals from the highest court of a state of the Union, but only
# where the state court has decided against the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, or of an authority exercised under the United States;
# where a state court has affirmed the validity of a statute, or of an uthority exercised which has been challenged on the ground of repugnance to the constitution, laws or treaties of the United States;
# where the state court has decided against the existence of a title, right, privilege, or immunity claimed or set up under the constitution of, or under any statute, treaty, commission or authority of the United States.

The appeal from state courts is by writ of error, i.e. on law only; and applies as well in criminal as in civil cases. The Supreme Court will not act unless the federal question was raised in the court below (Chicago U. S. Mail Co. v. McGuire, 1904, 196, U.S. 128). The circuit court of appeals, established in 1891, deals with appeals from the district and circuit courts of the United States, except where other provision is made, e.g. where the jurisdiction of the court appealed from is in question; in prize causes and convictions of capital crimes (U.S. Statutes, 1801. c. 54. § 5); in cases involving the construction or application of the constitution; in cases arising in district or circuit courts involving the constitutional questions already stated as subject of appeal from state courts.

The review by the circuit court of appeals is effected by appeal or by writ of error, and its decision is final, with certain exceptions but with power to certify cases to the Supreme Court for instructions (1891, c. 511, § 6).

The Supreme Court hears appeals from the circuit court of appeals within the limits above stated, and appeals from the circuit and district courts in cases in which an appeal does not lie to the circuit court of appeals, and has power to issue a certiorari to transfer a case from the circuit court of Appeals.

The United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial de novo or an appeal on the record.

A trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by administrative agency, referees, masters, commissioners and some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial.  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record.  In such a proceeding, all issues and evidence may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.

In an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  Precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error, that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court&apos;s jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court&apos;s judgment on the grounds that one did not &quot;preserve the issue for appeal&quot; by objecting.

In cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court&apos;s view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it was a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court&apos;s decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.

In some rare cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.

An appellate court is a court that hears cases in which a lower court -- either a trial court or a lower-level appellate court   has already made a decision, but in which at least one party to the action wants to challenge this ruling based upon some legal grounds that are allowed to be appealed either by right or by leave of the appellate court.  These grounds typically include errors of law, fact, or due process.

In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

<h1>Who can appeal</h1>
A party who files an appeal is called an appellant, and a party on the other side is an appellee or respondent or, in some jurisdictions, the party who files is known as a petitioner and the party being sued is designated the respondent.  Cross-appeals can also occur, when more than one party to a case is unhappy with the decision in some way, often when the winning party claims that more damages were deserved than were awarded.

In criminal matters, an appeal can be filed generally only by a convicted defendant due to the double jeopardy principle, but in tort, equity, or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.

An appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to move for leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the appellate court have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant&apos;s demand to appeal the lower court&apos;s decision.

<h1>How an appeal is processed</h1>
Generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court&apos;s findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court&apos;s application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).

If the appellate court finds no defect, it &quot;affirms&quot; the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision &quot;below&quot; (i.e., in the lower court), it may &quot;modify&quot; the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (&quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;vacate&quot;) the whole decision or any part of it.  It may in addition send the case back (&quot;remand&quot; or &quot;remit&quot;) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.

In some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo (or completely), challenging even the lower court&apos;s findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.

Another situation is where appeal is by way of re-hearing. Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court. An example would be an appeal from a Magistrate&apos;s court to the Crown Court in England and Wales.

Sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court&apos;s rules, to file the appeal.)  In England and many other jurisdictions, however, the phrase appeal dismissed is equivalent to the U.S. term affirmed; and the phrase appeal allowed is equivalent to the U.S. term reversed.

Generally there is no trial in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed   unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct.

In some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.

The appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.

It is important to note that in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against legal precedent that judgment will stand even if it might have been overturned on appeal.

In the United States, a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words &quot;May it please the court.&quot;

:ANSWER is also the name of an anti-war protest group

An answer (derived from and, against, and the same root as swear) was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to some one or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or defence, a reply to a question or objection, or a correct solution of a problem.  In the common law, an answer is the first pleading by a defendant, usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an optional &quot;pre-answer&quot; motion to dismiss or demurrer; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment.

The answer establishes which allegations (cause of action in civil matters) set forth by the complaining party will be contested by the defendant, and states all the defendant&apos;s defenses, thus establishing the nature and parameters of the controversy to be decided by the court.

In the case of a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the court by the defendant.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is either guilty or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or an injunction. Criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment, such as imprisonment.

The famous Latin Responsa Prudentum (&quot;answers of the learned&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman lawyers, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.

In music an &quot;answer&quot; is the technical name in counterpoint for the repetition by one part or instrument of a theme proposed by another.

Arraignment is a common law term for the formal reading of a criminal complaint, in the presence of the defendant, to inform him of the charges against him. In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a plea. Acceptable pleas vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but they generally include &quot;guilty&quot;, &quot;not guilty&quot;, and the peremptory pleas (or pleas in bar), which set out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. In addition, US jurisdictions allow pleas of &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) and the &quot;Alford plea&quot; in some circumstances.

In the UK arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment. The defendant is asked whether they plead guilty or not guilty to each individual charge.

<h1>Guilty and Not Guilty pleas</h1>
If the defendant pleads guilty an evidentiary hearing usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During that hearing the judge will assess the offense, mitigating factors, and the defendant&apos;s character; and then pass sentence. If the defendant pleads not guilty, a date will be set for a preliminary hearing or trial.

<h1>What if the defendant enters no plea?</h1>
In the past, a defendant who refused to plea (or, &quot;stood mute&quot;) would be subjected to peine forte et dure. But today in all common law jurisdictions, defendants who refuse to enter a plea will have a plea of not guilty entered for them on their behalf.

<h1>The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</h1>
The US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure state: &quot;...arraignment shall...[consist of an] open...reading [of] the indictment...to the defendant...and calling on him to plead thereto. He shall be given a copy of the indictment...before he is called upon to plead.&quot;

&quot;America the Beautiful&quot; is an American patriotic song which rivals &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States, in popularity.  It is often found in Christian hymnals in a wide variety of churches in the United States, and may be sung as part of a Christian service of worship to God.

<h1>History</h1>

The words are by Katharine Lee Bates, an English teacher at Wellesley College. She had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1893 to teach a short summer school session at Colorado College, and several of the sights on her trip found their way into her poem:
*The World&apos;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois, the &quot;White City&quot; with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings.
*The wheat fields of Kansas, through which her train was riding on July 4.
*The majestic view of the Great Plains from atop Pike&apos;s Peak.
On that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel. The poem was initially published two years later in The Congregationalist, to commemorate the Fourth of July. It quickly caught the public&apos;s fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1913.

Several existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. The hymn Materna, composed in 1882 by Samuel A. Ward, was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Ward had been similarly inspired. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City after a leisurely summer day, and he immediately wrote it down. Ward died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain. Miss Bates was more fortunate, as the song&apos;s popularity was well-established by her death in 1929.

At various times in the nearly 100 years that have elapsed since the song as we know it was born, particularly during the John F. Kennedy administration, there have been efforts to give &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; legal status either as a national hymn, or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, but so far this has not succeeded. Proponents prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Some prefer &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; over &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; due to the latter&apos;s war-oriented imagery. (Others prefer &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; for the same reason.) While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.

Popularity of the song soared following the September 11, 2001 attacks; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem.

Ray Charles is credited with the song&apos;s most well known rendition in current times. His recording is very commonly played at major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl. His unique take on it places the third verse first, after which he sings the usual first verse. In the third verse (see below), the author scolds the materialistic and self-serving robber barons of her day, and urges America to live up to its noble ideals and to honor, with both word and deed, the memory of those who died for their country...a message that resonates just as strongly today.

An amusing oddity of the song is that its meter (technically &quot;common meter double&quot; or 8-6-8-6-8-6-8-6) is identical to that of Auld Lang Syne. The two songs can be sung perfectly with lyrics interchanged.

<h1>Lyrics</h1>
Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,

For amber waves of grain,

For purple mountain majesties

Above the fruited plain!

America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,

And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea.

Oh beautiful, for pilgrims&apos; feet

Whose stern, impassioned stress

A thoroughfare for freedom beat

Across the wilderness!

America! America!  God mend thine ev&apos;ry flaw;

Confirm thy soul in self control, thy liberty in law!

Oh beautiful, for heroes proved

In liberating strife,

Who more than self their country loved

And mercy more than life!

America! America!  May God thy gold refine,

&apos;Til all success be nobleness, and ev&apos;ry gain divine!

Oh beautiful, for patriot&apos;s dream

That sees beyond the years!

Thine alabaster cities gleam

Undimmed by human tears!

America! America!  God shed his grace on thee,

And crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea!

<h1>Takeoffs</h1>
A song as popular and familiar as &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; inevitably gets used out of its proper context or time frame, for humorous effect. As the song seems to have &quot;always been there&quot;, it is often presented as if Christopher Columbus had written it when he arrived at the New World (though in fact, Columbus never set foot on North America; all his voyages were to the Caribbean islands, South and Central America). Some examples:

*A Far Side cartoon from 1982 (reprinted in Sherr&apos;s book) shows Columbus nearing land, with his crew of conquistador types, and saying, &quot;Look, gentlemen! Purple mountains! Spacious skies! Fruited plains! ... Is someone writing this down?&quot;

*In one of his comedy club routines in the early 1960s, Flip Wilson did a Columbus story with an African-American twist... ironically, the catchphrase repeated by Queen Isabel (an early &quot;Geraldine&quot;) is &quot;Chris gon&apos; find Ray Charles!&quot;  When his Columbus sees land, he comments, &quot;It&apos;s America, all right... just look at those spacious skies... those amber waves of grain... dig that purple mountain&apos;s majesty... I&apos;ll bet there&apos;s fruit out there on the plain!&quot;

*In his satirical, musical record album, The United States of America, Volume 1, Stan Freberg plays Columbus, Jesse White plays a skeptical King Ferdinand, and Colleen Collins does Queen Isabella (mimicking Tallulah Bankhead), resulting in this bit of dialogue:

:Ferdinand: Look at him in that hat! Is that a crazy sailor? 
:Isabella: Crazy? I&apos;ll tell you how crazy! He&apos;s a man with a dream, a vision, a vision of a new world, whose alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears, with purple mountain majesties above the Two Cents Plain . . . 
:Ferdinand and Columbus: Fruited!
:Isabella: Fruited.

George Carlin performed a satirical version around 1970, when environmental issues were becoming a hot political topic:

:Oh beautiful, for smoggy skies, insecticided grain
:For strip-mined mountain&apos;s majesty above the asphalt plain.
:America, America, man sheds his waste on thee
:And hides the pines with billboard signs, from sea to oily sea!
