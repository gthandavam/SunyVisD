parse_and_prepare module takes care of reading the input file and writing the output file
The file is read once and a graph is built for one sentence at a time.

Credits for the terse pagerank implementation:

for running evaluation paths to database file should be tuned in document_relatedness.py.
Also, output file should be specified in parse_and_prepare.py (by default - pagerank-output)

For running:

sudo ./parse_and_prepare.py


The number of entries in database is really small, and there is a very small number of overlapping concepts between randomly picked words.
