First you will need Git to download the program and sample files If you’re not used to Git this might be a bit of a pain now as opposed to just a straightforward download But because Overview is a prototype under active development we’re constantly fixing bugs and adding features and Git lets you download and install new versions in one easy step Git can be downloaded here for Windows and here for Mac

You will also need Ruby to run Overview For windows you can download an installer here Be sure to download the latest Ruby version 193 because Ruby 187 won’t work On the Mac you’re in luck because Ruby comes pre-installed

Overview also needs Java Windows comes with Java preinstalled these days Some versions of OS X come with Java too and the ones that don’t will asked you want to install Java the first time you try to run Overview Say yes However there have been some reports that Overview won’t run with the Java version that comes with OS X 105 and above so 106 or above is recommended

If you’re on Linux you’re probably already comfortable with standard development tools so I’m just say that you need to get Git Ruby 193 and Java going You will also need to replace visualization/lib/swtjar with the appropriate version for your operating system

Installing the prototype
Now that you have Git installed you can download the Overview program files by entering the following command in Terminal Mac or the command prompt Windows  like so
